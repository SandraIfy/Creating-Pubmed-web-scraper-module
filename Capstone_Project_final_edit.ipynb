The loading of metal ions further enhances Lewis acidity, augmenting the activity associated with such frameworks. Metal-loaded ionic POFs, however, often suffer from physicochemical instability, thereby limiting their scope for diverse applications. Herein, we report the fabrication of triaminoguanidinium-based ionic POFs through Schiff base condensation in a cost-effective and scalable manner. The resultant N-rich ionic frameworks facilitate selective CO(2) uptake and afford high metal (Zn(ii): 47.2%) loading capacity. Owing to the ionic guanidinium core and ZnO infused mesoporous frameworks, Zn/POFs showed pronounced catalytic activity in the cycloaddition of CO(2) and epoxides into cyclic organic carbonates under solvent-free conditions with high catalyst recyclability. The synergistic effect of infused ZnO and cationic triaminoguanidinium frameworks in Zn/POFs led to robust antibacterial (Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative, Escherichia coli) and antiviral activity targeting HIV-1 and VSV-G enveloped lentiviral particles. We thus present triaminoguanidinium-based POFs and Zn/POFs as a new class of multifunctional materials for environmental remediation and biomedical applications.')\n",

We investigated treatment outcomes among people living with HIV in Asia who continued with failing second-line regimens compared with those who had treatment modifications after failure. METHODS: Treatment modification was defined as a change of two antiretrovirals, a drug class change or treatment interruption (TI), all for >14 days. We assessed factors associated with CD4 changes and undetectable viral load (UVL <1,000 copies/ml) at 1 year after second-line failure using linear and logistic regression, respectively. Survival time was analysed using competing risk regression. RESULTS: Of the 328 patients who failed second-line ART in our cohorts, 208 (63%) had a subsequent treatment modification. Compared with those who continued the failing regimen, the average CD4 cell increase was higher in patients who had a modification without TI (difference =77.5, 95% CI 35.3, 119.7) while no difference was observed among those with TI (difference =-5.3, 95% CI -67.3, 56.8). Compared with those who continued the failing regimen, the odds of achieving UVL was lower in patients with TI (OR=0.18, 95% CI 0.06, 0.60) and similar among those who had a modification without TI (OR=1.97, 95% CI 0.95, 4.10), with proportions of UVL 60%, 22% and 75%, respectively.

However, strict compliance is a necessary step to begin with as noncompliance is again associated with its own demerits of incomplete suppression and decreasing the overall survival of the patients. AIMS: The aim of this study was to measure factors associated with adherence to ART among CLHIV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a 1-year follow-up study conducted from November 2012 to December 2013. A total of 171 children between 18 months and 15 years living with HIV and on ART attending the two ART centers of Delhi were enrolled in the study. Adherence and factors affecting adherence were obtained from the study participants using a semi-structured interview schedule. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Collected data were transformed into variables and analyzed into SPSS. All observations were in terms of mean, median, standard deviations, percentages, and proportions. Tests of significance such as Chi-square test and t-test were applied wherever required. RESULTS: In nearly 89% of the study participants, adherence to ART was >/=95% at the end of the study. The most common reason for nonadherence was forgetfulness (59%), and 57% of the parents/caretakers were facing monetary problems. Long distance, greater duration to reach center, and unavailability of the parents/caretakers were also quoted as problems. CONCLUSION: Adherence is genesis to successful treatment outcome and is strongly associated with availability of support by their parents/caretakers.

An adequate response of the mucosal immune system is essential to protect the mucosa against pathological conditions. Hence, a detailed review was planned about this unique antigen-presenting cell. METHODS: A literature search of the electronic databases included the MEDLINE, EBSCOHOST, PUBMED, and hand searches of references retrieved were undertaken using the following MeSH terms \"Langerhans cells,\" \"LCs in Oral Lichen Planus,\" \"Langerhans cell histiocytosis,\" \"LCs and HIV,\" \"LCs in Periodontitis.\" RESULTS: LCs are present suprabasally in the epithelium of oral mucosa and in the epidermis of the skin. The role played by LCs though not fully elucidated, but several research studies indicate that these cells are involved in the pathogenesis of many oral diseases. In this article, the historical perspective, structure, function, origin, and phenotypic expressions of LCs are discussed in detail. The current understanding on the role of LCs in various oral lesions and its immunological characteristics are discussed. CONCLUSION: LCs act as immune mediator cells, tumor cells, vectors of infected cells, and phagocytic cells. Further studies could bolster the knowledge about the role of Langerhans cells in the immune response of various oral diseases and thereby provide diagnostic tools and help for prognostic evaluation.

Here we infected primary CD4 T cells with a wild-type HIV-1 and investigated the death and survival mechanisms in productively infected and bystander cells during early HIV infection. We found that HIV-infected cells exhibited increased programmed cell death, such as apoptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, than uninfected cells. However, productively infected (p24(+)) cells and bystander (p24(-)) cells displayed different patterns of cell death due to differential expression of pro-/anti-apoptotic proteins and signaling molecules. Cell death was triggered by an aberrant DNA damage response (DDR), as evidenced by increases in gammaH2AX levels, which inversely correlated with telomere length and telomerase levels during HIV infection. Mechanistically, HIV-infected cells exhibited a gradual shortening of telomeres following infection. Notably, p24(+) cells had longer telomeres compared to p24(-) cells, and telomere length positively correlated with the telomerase, pAKT, and pATM expressions in HIV-infected CD4 T cells. Importantly, blockade of viral entry attenuated the HIV-induced inhibition of telomerase, pAKT, and pATM as well as the associated telomere erosion and cell death. Moreover, ATM inhibition promoted survival of HIV-infected CD4 T cells, especially p24(+) cells, and rescued telomerase and AKT activities by inhibiting cell activation, HIV infection, and DDR. These results indicate that productively infected and bystander CD4 T cells employ different mechanisms for their survival and death, suggesting a possible pro-survival, pro-reservoir mechanism during early HIV infection.')\n",

The advent of combined antiretroviral therapy has considerably increased the life span; however, the incidence of chronic lung diseases is significantly higher among PLWH. Lung epithelial cells orchestrate the respiratory immune responses and whether these cells are productively infected by HIV-1 is debatable. METHODS: Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs) grown on air-liquid interface were infected with X4-tropic HIV-1(LAV) and examined for latency using latency-reversing agents (LRAs). The role of CD4 and CXCR4 HIV coreceptors in NHBEs were tested, and DNA sequencing analysis was used to analyze the genomic integration of HIV proviral genes, Alu-HIVgag-pol, HIV-nef, and HIV-LTR. Lung epithelial sections from HIV-infected humans and SHIV-infected macaques were analyzed by FISH for HIV-gag-pol RNA and epithelial cell-specific immunostaining. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: NHBEs express CD4 and CXCR4 at higher levels than A549 cells. NHBEs are infected with HIV-1 basolaterally, but not apically, by X4-tropic HIV-1(LAV) in a CXCR4/CD4-dependent manner leading to HIV-p24 antigen production; however, NHBEs are induced to express CCR5 by IL-13 treatment. In the presence of cART, HIV-1 induces latency and integration of HIV provirus in the cellular DNA, which is rescued by the LRAs (endotoxin/vorinostat). Furthermore, lung epithelial cells from HIV-infected humans and SHIV-infected macaques contain HIV-specific RNA transcripts. Thus, lung epithelial cells are targeted by HIV-1 and could serve as potential HIV reservoirs that may contribute to the respiratory comorbidities in PLWH.')\n",

This study aimed to assess the incidence and predictors of anemia among children on antiretroviral therapy, attending antiretroviral therapy care at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, from 2007 to 2017. METHODS: A retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 391 children on antiretroviral therapy. Mean survival time for children to be anemia free was estimated. A Log rank test was used to compare survival curves among different independent variables. The Cox regression model was used. The adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. P-value </=0.05 was considered as statically significant. RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of anemia was 10.5 (95% confidence interval (8.6, 12.8)) per 100 child-year.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of 9,026 smear-positive patients aged 15-49 years. All-cause mortality during TB treatment was the outcome of interest. Time to start of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation was considered as a proxy for CD4 cell count. Those who took long to start of ART were assumed to have high CD4 cell count. RESULTS: Of the 9,026 observations analysed, 4,567(51%) and 4,459(49%) were women and men, respectively. Overall, out of the 9,026 patients, 8,154 (90%) had their treatment outcome as cured, the mean age in years (SD) was 33.3(7.5) and the mean body mass index (SD) was 18.2(3.4). Men were older (30% men' vs 17% women in those >/=40 years, p = <0.001) and had a lower BMI <18.5 (55.3% men vs 50.6% women, p = <0.001). Men tested later for HIV: 29% (1,317/4,567) of women HIV tested more than 3 months prior to TB treatment, as compared to 20% (912/4,459) men (p<0.001). Mortality was higher in men 11% (471/4,459) compared to women 9% (401/4,567, p = 0.004). There was a 17% reduction in the risk of death among women (adjusted HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72-0.96; p = 0.013). Survival varied by age-groups, with women having significantly better survival than men, in the age-groups 40 years and over (log-rank p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Women with sputum positive PTB/HIV co-infection have a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality during TB treatment compared to men. Men were older, had lower BMI and tested later for HIV than women.\")\n",

In 2015, the sample design and frame of MMP changed from a system that only included HIV patients to one that captures the experiences of persons receiving and not receiving HIV care. We describe methods investigated for calculating survey weights, the approach chosen, and the benefits of using a dynamic surveillance registry as a sampling frame. METHODS: MMP samples adults with diagnosed HIV from the National HIV Surveillance System, the HIV case surveillance registry for the United States. In the methodological study presented in this manuscript, we compared methods that account for sample design and nonresponse, including weighting class adjustment vs. propensity weighting and a single-stage nonresponse adjustment vs. sequential adjustments for noncontact and nonresponse. We investigated how best to adjust for non-coverage using surveillance data to post-stratify estimates. RESULTS: After assessing these methods, we chose as our preferred procedure weighting class adjustments and a single-stage nonresponse adjustment. Classes were constructed using variables associated with respondents' characteristics and important survey outcomes, chief among them laboratory results available from surveillance that served as a proxy for medical care. CONCLUSIONS: MMPs weighting procedures reduced sample bias by leveraging auxiliary information on medical care available from the surveillance registry sampling frame. Expanding MMPs population of focus provides important information on characteristics of persons with diagnosed HIV that complement the information provided by the surveillance registry. MMP methods can be applied to other disease registries or population-monitoring systems when more detailed information is needed for a population, with the detailed information obtained efficiently from a representative sample of the population covered by the registry.\")\n",

Tools now exist to undertake in-depth analysis using systems biology approaches, but to be fully realized, studies are required in humans with intensive blood and tissue sampling. Methods that support this intensive sampling need to be developed and validated as feasible. To this end, we describe here a detailed approach that was applied in a study of 15 healthy adults, who were immunized with hepatitis B vaccine. Sampling included ~350 mL of blood, 12 microbiome samples, and lymph node fine needle aspirates obtained over a ~7-month period, enabling comprehensive analysis of the immune response at the molecular level, including single cell and tissue sample analysis. Samples were collected for analysis of immune phenotyping, whole blood and single cell gene expression, proteomics, lipidomics, epigenetics, whole blood response to key immune stimuli, cytokine responses, in vitro T cell responses, antibody repertoire analysis and the microbiome. Data integration was undertaken using different approaches-NetworkAnalyst and DIABLO. Our results demonstrate that such intensive sampling studies are feasible in healthy adults, and data integration tools exist to analyze the vast amount of data generated from a multi-omics systems biology approach.

METHODS: LHIV, age >18 (n=101), participated in the study who were followed up at a teaching hospital in Muscat, Oman. Participants were identified by a convenient and consecutive sampling of eligible patients who came for consultation on the days that the investigator conducted recruitment. The presence of depressive symptoms was quantified by the Patient Healthcare Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Various socio-demographic backgrounds and risk factors will be also sought as well as activities of daily living (ADL). Chi-square test, Fisher s exact test, t-test and logistic regression were used to explore which variables were associated with patients having depressive symptoms. RESULTS: the prevalence rate of depressive symptoms in this cohort was 41.6%. Depression among PLHIV was found to be significantly associated with age (p <0.001), HIV disease duration (p <0.001), total dependency for ADL (p <0.001) and comorbid hypertension (p <0.001).

Demographic data and clinical manifestations were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: We included 10 HIV-infected patients and divided them into two groups: infectious and non-infectious ON. There were six patients in the infectious ON group (five males, mean age 33.6 years, median CD4 cell counts during ON episodes 36.5 cells/microL, high viral loads, median initial visual acuity [VA] 1.7, median VA difference [initial VA - follow-up VA] 0).

Between 2012 and 2016, the largest percent increase in the prevalence rate of HIV was among people aged 65 and older, the eligibility age for Medicare coverage for individuals without a disability or other qualifying condition. Previous work suggests that older people with HIV may have higher rates of chronic conditions and develop them more rapidly than older people who do not have HIV. This study compared the health status of older people with HIV with the older US population not living with HIV by comparing: (1) mortality; (2) prevalence of certain conditions, and (3) incidence of these conditions with increasing age. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older from the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File for the years 2011 to 2016, including 100% of individuals with HIV (N = 43,708), as well as a random 1% sample of individuals without diagnosed HIV (N = 1,029,518). We conducted a survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model to assess mortality and to determine the need to adjust for differential mortality in our analyses of the incidence of certain chronic conditions. These results showed that Medicare beneficiaries living with HIV have a significantly higher hazard of mortality compared to older people without diagnosed HIV (3.6 times the hazard). We examined the prevalence of these conditions using logistic regression analysis and found that people with HIV have a statistically significant higher odds of depression, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), osteoporosis, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, chronic hepatitis, end-stage liver disease, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. To look at the rate at which older people are diagnosed with conditions as they age, we used a Fine-Gray competing risk model and showed that for individuals without diagnosis of a given condition at age 65, the future incidence of that condition over the remaining study period was higher for people with HIV even after adjusting for differential hazard of mortality and for other demographic characteristics. Many of these results also varied by personal characteristics including Medicaid dual enrollment, sex, and race and ethnicity, as well as by condition. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing access to care and improving health outcomes for people with HIV is a critical goal of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2020. It is important for clinicians and policymakers to be aware that despite significant advances in the treatment and care of people with HIV, older people with HIV have a higher odds of having multiple chronic conditions at any point in time, a higher incidence of new diagnoses of these conditions over time, and a higher hazard of mortality than Medicare beneficiaries without HIV.')\n",

The aim of this study was to identify the level of genetic changes in the Vpu gene from HIV-1-infected North Indian individuals and determine the functional relevance with respect to the CD4 downregulation potential of this protein. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the Vpu gene was polymerase chain reaction amplified with specific primers followed by cloning, sequencing, and sequence analyses using bioinformatic tools for predicting HIV-1 subtypes, recombination events, conservation of domains, and phosphorylation sites. Among all Vpu variants, three of the variants having serine substitution (serine-52 and serine-56 conversion to isoleucine; S52I and S56I) had lost their functional beta-TrcP binding motif. However, the specific determinants for CD4 (V20, W22, S23) and BST-2 (A11, A15, I17, and A19) binding remained highly conserved.

In line with this, Th17 cells represent selective HIV-1 infection targets mainly at mucosal sites, with long-lived Th17 subsets carrying replication-competent HIV-DNA during ART. Therefore, novel Th17-specific therapeutic interventions are needed as a supplement of ART to reach the goal of HIV remission/cure. Th17 cells express high levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy), which acts as a transcriptional repressor of the HIV provirus and the rorc gene, which encodes for the Th17-specific master regulator RORyt. Thus, we hypothesized that the pharmacological inhibition of PPARy will facilitate HIV reservoir reactivation while enhancing Th17 effector functions. Consistent with this prediction, the PPARy antagonist T0070907 significantly increased HIV transcription (cell-associated HIV-RNA) and RORyt-mediated Th17 effector functions (IL-17A). Unexpectedly, the PPARy antagonism limited HIV outgrowth from cells of ART-treated people living with HIV (PLWH), as well as HIV replication in vitro. Mechanistically, PPARy inhibition in CCR6(+)CD4(+) T cells induced the upregulation of transcripts linked to Th17-polarisation (RORyt, STAT3, BCL6 IL-17A/F, IL-21) and HIV transcription (NCOA1-3, CDK9, HTATIP2). Interestingly, several transcripts involved in HIV-restriction were upregulated (Caveolin-1, TRIM22, TRIM5alpha, BST2, miR-29), whereas HIV permissiveness transcripts were downregulated (CCR5, furin), consistent with the decrease in HIV outgrowth/replication. Finally, PPARy inhibition increased intracellular HIV-p24 expression and prevented BST-2 downregulation on infected T cells, suggesting that progeny virion release is restricted by BST-2-dependent mechanisms. These results provide a strong rationale for considering PPARy antagonism as a novel strategy for HIV-reservoir purging and restoring Th17-mediated mucosal immunity in ART-treated PLWH.')\n",

Questionnaires were administered at baseline, three, six, and 12 months. Alcohol use was assessed as proportion of days alcohol abstinent. Analyses were restricted to males who reported being married/cohabitating at baseline (N = 313). Multilevel growth models were used to test whether time-varying depressive symptoms modified the time-varying effect of alcohol use on IPV perpetration. RESULTS: Time-varying depressive symptoms modified the effect of proportion of days alcohol abstinent on IPV perpetration. However, the pattern of effect modification was not as expected, as reporting depressive symptoms weakened the alcohol-IPV relationship. At times when participants screened negative for depressive symptoms, those who reported higher proportion of days alcohol abstinent than usual had significantly lower odds of IPV perpetration (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.17, 95% Confidence Interval 0.06, 0.45, p = 0.0004). At times when participants screened positive for depressive symptoms, there was no observed effect of alcohol use on IPV perpetration (OR = 4.28, 95% CI 0.80, 22.78, p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the complex nature of the alcohol-IPV relationship and the need to investigate the intersection between hazardous drinking, mental health, and IPV. Men who concurrently report depressive symptoms and heightened alcohol use may be socially isolated from an intimate partner or experiencing fatigue, leading to less alcohol-related IPV perpetration. Mental health interventions addressing depression and alcohol misuse integrated into HIV services may reduce IPV perpetration.')\n",

With the aim of significantly lowering global HIV rates, prevention programs like VMMC make every effort to achieve ambitious targets at an increasingly reduced cost. This has the potential to threaten VMMC program quality. Two measures of program quality are follow-up and adverse event (AE) rates. To inform further VMMC program improvement, ZAZIC conducted a quality assurance (QA) activity to assess if pressure to do more with less influenced program quality. METHODS: Key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted at 9 sites with 7 site-based VMMC program officers and 9 ZAZIC roving team members. Confidentiality was ensured to encourage candid conversation on adherence to VMMC standards, methods to increase productivity, challenges to target achievement, and suggestions for program modification. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using Atlas.ti 6. RESULTS: VMMC teams work long hours in diverse community settings to reach ambitious targets. Rotating, large teams of trained VMMC providers ensures meeting demand. Service providers prioritize VMMC safety procedures and implement additional QA measures to prevent AEs among all clients, especially minors. However, KIs noted three areas where pressure for increased numbers of clients diminished adherence to VMMC safety standards. For pre- and post-operative counselling, MC teams may combine individual and group sessions to reach more people, potentially reducing client understanding of critical wound care instructions. Second, key infection control practices may be compromised (handwashing, scrubbing techniques, and preoperative client preparation) to speed MC procedures. Lastly, pressure for client numbers may reduce prioritization of patient follow-up, while client-perceived stigma may reduce care-seeking. Although AEs appear well managed, delays in AE identification and lack of consistent AE reporting compromise program quality. CONCLUSION: In pursuit of ambitious targets, healthcare workers may compromise quality of MC services. Although risk to patients may appear minimal, careful consideration of the realities and risks of ambitious target setting by donors, ministries, and implementing partners could help to ensure that client safety and program quality is consistently prioritized over productivity.')\n",

We conducted a community-based survey to determine outcomes of HIV-exposed infants at 18-24 months in Lesotho. METHODS: Between November 2015 and December 2016, we conducted a survey among households with a child born 18-24 months prior to data collection. Catchment areas from 25 health facilities in Butha-Buthe, Maseru, Mohale's Hoek and Thaba-Tseka districts were randomly selected using probability proportional to size sampling. Consecutive households were visited and eligible consenting caregivers and children were enrolled. Rapid HIV antibody testing was performed on mothers of unknown HIV status (never tested or tested HIV-negative >3 months prior) and their children, and to children born to known HIV-positive mothers. Information on demographics, health-seeking behavior, HIV, and mortality were captured for mothers and children, including those who died. The difference in survival between subgroups was determined using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Of the 1,852 mothers/caregivers enrolled, 570 mothers were HIV-positive. The mother-to-child HIV transmission rate was 5.7% [95% CI: 4.0-8.0]. The mortality rate was 2.6% [95% CI: 1.6-4.2] among HIV-exposed children compared to 1.4% (95% CI: 0.9-2.3) among HIV-unexposed children. HIV-free survival was 91.8% [95% CI: 89.2-93.8] among HIV-exposed infants. Disclosure of mother's HIV status (aOR = 4.9, 95% CI: 1.3-18.2) and initiation of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in the child (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.2-12.6) were independently associated with increased HIV-free survival while child growth problems (aOR = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.09-0.5) were independently associated with reduced HIV-free survival.

METHODS: ED patients were stratified by primary language spoken (English or Spanish) and health literacy level (lower or higher) and randomly assigned to watch the study video or review the content-matched pictorial brochure. HIV/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge, motivation for HIV testing, and behavioral skills for HIV testing were assessed using study instruments before and after watching the video or reviewing the pictorial brochure. RESULTS: Of the 712 English- and 655 Spanish-speaking ED patients, HIV/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge improved more among participants in the video than the pictorial brochure arm (∆ 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07, 0.79). This improvement was more pronounced among those with lower (∆ 0.60; 95% CI: 0.06, 1.13) than higher health literacy (∆ 0.27; 95% CI: -0.22, 0.76). HIV testing motivation was high before the intervention and did not increase differentially between arms. Confidence in recognizing when to be tested for HIV was slightly greater in the video than pictorial brochure arm (∆ 0.15; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.28), but did not differ by language spoken or health literacy level.

In Vietnam, alcohol use is highly normative making it socially challenging for PWH to reduce or abstain. We used mixed methods to develop a quantitative scale to assess alcohol abstinence stigma and examined the association between alcohol abstinence stigma with alcohol use among PWH in Vietnam. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with 30 PWH with hazardous alcohol use from an antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic in the Thai Nguyen to inform item development. Alcohol use was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. We tested items in a survey of 1,559 ART clinic patients to assess internal consistency and structural validity. We used log binomial modeling to estimate associations between any reported alcohol abstinence stigma and alcohol use. RESULTS: Using the results from the qualitative interview data, we developed the alcohol abstinence stigma scale with seven final items with scores ranging from 0 (no stigma) to 28 (high stigma). The scale had good internal consistency (alpha = 0.75). Exploratory factor analysis suggested the presence of three factors: internalized, experienced, and anticipated stigma that explained 56.9% of the total variance. The mean score was 2.74, (SD = 4.28) and 46% reported any alcohol abstinence stigma. We observed a dose-response relationship between alcohol abstinence stigma and alcohol use. PWH who reported any alcohol abstinence stigma had greater hazardous alcohol use (aPR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.56), harmful alcohol use (aPR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.37, 3.72), and dependence symptoms (aPR = 3.81, 95% CI: 2.19, 6.64).

Given the economic impact, French guidelines recommend using generic antiretroviral therapy when possible to decrease antiretroviral therapy costs. We aimed to study HIV-infected patients' acceptability to switch from a brand single-tablet regimens [abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (Triumeq(R)) or emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/rilpivirine (Eviplera(R))] to a treatment comprising of two pills: one is a fixed-dose generic combination of 2 Nucleoside Analogs and the second tablet is the third antiretroviral. This study was a prospective observational study in a French hospital. During their follow-up, patients on stable single-tablet regimens were made aware of the possible cost-saving. They were questioned about their willingness and barriers accepting the substitution. Participants chose between the two regimens, either to remain on single-tablet regimens or switch to the de-simplified regimen. Six months later, a second survey was given to the patient who chose to de-simplify and HIV viral load was controlled. The study included 98 patients: 60 receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/rilpivirine (Eviplera(R)) and 38 on abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (Triumeq(R)). Forty-five patients accepted the de-simplified treatment, 37 refused and 16 were undecided and followed the decision offered by their physician. The main reason for unwillingness to switch is the number of pills (77.3%). In multivariate model analysis, male patients (p = 0.001) who have taken antiretroviral therapy for over 20 years (p = 0.04) and who retrieve their treatment in their community hospital (p = 0.03) are more likely to accept the switch. Fifty-one patients accepted to replace their single-tablet regimens and six months later, the majority was satisfied; only four returned to single-tablet regimens because of suspected side effects. Half of the people living with HIV/AIDS in our cohort accepted to switch from brand single-tablet regimens to a two-tablet regimen containing generic drugs within a process that emphasizes health expenditure savings.\")\n",

The mechanisms underlying these HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders remain poorly understood but are often accelerated by the aging process and accompanied by disturbances in sensory processing, which may contribute to the observed cognitive decline. The goal of the current study was to identify the impact of aging on HIV-related alterations in inhibitory processing and determine whether such alterations are related to cognitive impairment in neuroHIV. We used magnetoencephalographic imaging, advanced time series analysis methods, and a paired-pulse stimulation paradigm to interrogate inhibitory processing in 87 HIV-infected aging adults and 92 demographically matched uninfected controls (22-72 years old). Whole-brain maps linking age and neural indices were computed for each group and compared via Fisher's Z transformations. Peak voxel time-series data were also extracted from the resulting images to quantify the dynamics of spontaneous neural activity preceding stimulation onset in each group. Whole-brain analyses using the somatosensory gating index, a metric of inhibitory processing and age distinguished impaired adults with HIV from unimpaired HIV-infected adults and controls. Briefly, younger cognitively impaired adults with HIV strongly utilized the prefrontal cortices to gate somatosensory input, and the role of this region in gating was uniquely and significantly modulated by aging only in impaired adults with HIV. Spontaneous neural activity preceding stimulus onset was also significantly elevated in the prefrontal cortices of those with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and this elevation was significantly related to the CD4 nadir across both HIV-infected groups. This is the first study to examine the impact of aging on inhibitory processing in HIV-infected adults with and without cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that young adults with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder utilize the prefrontal cortices to gate (i.e. suppress) redundant somatosensory input, and that this capacity uniquely diminishes with advancing age in impaired adults with HIV.\")\n",

Transgender women are exposed to gender-based violence and social stigma and discrimination in different settings that may create significant barriers to receiving HIV prevention and care services. This study aimed to identify factors associated with recent HIV testing among transgender women in Cambodia. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2016 among 1375 transgender women recruited from 13 provinces using a peer-based social network recruitment method. We used a structured questionnaire for face-to-face interviews and performed rapid HIV/syphilis testing onsite. We used a multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with recent HIV testing.

METHODS: We used baseline data from a randomized controlled trial of two evidence-based alcohol reduction interventions among antiretroviral therapy clients in Vietnam. Hazardous alcohol use was defined as having a score >/=8 for men and >/= 7 for women on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. The presence of depression symptoms was defined as a score >/= 5 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Social support was measured with a 5-question modified version of the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Instrument.

Automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) had been used in clinical laboratories but not applied to screen HIV among blood donors. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ELISA, CLIA, and ECLIA, focusing on the feasibility of CLIA/ECLIA for blood screening. METHOD: 1029 blood donations from 14 blood centers screened by ELISA were enrolled in the study. All plasma samples were tested by eight ELISA assays in 16 blood centers, followed by the detection of CLIA and ECLIA methods in the National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL), further confirmed by nucleic acid testing (NAT) and Western blot (WB). RESULTS: Of 1029 samples, 136 were confirmed as HIV positive. CLIA and ECLIA assay had similar sensitivities with ELISAs but showed higher specificity (CLIA: 99.1%, 885/893; ECLIA: 99.0%, 884/893), concordance rate (CLIA: 99.2%, 1021/1029; ECLIA: 99.1%, 1020/1029), and positive predictive value (PPV) (CLIA: 94.4%, 136/144; ECLIA: 93.8%, 136/145) than most of ELISA kits (>5 ELISAs) (P < 0.05). Kappa values of CLIA (0.967) and ECLIA (0.963) were the highest among all the serologic assays. Among 451 samples with initial ELISA reactivity, 315 were negatives, of which 307 (97.5%) and 306 (97.1%) were detected as nonreactive by CLIA (8 nonspecific reactions) and ECLIA (9 nonspecific reactions), respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with ELISA, CLIA and ECLIA are more specific and accurate in detecting HIV antibody/antigen and can keep more nonspecifically reactive donors detected by ELISA. CLIA and ECLIA can be used for the improvement of serological blood screening strategy to avoid the unnecessary loss of blood donors.')\n",

Inducing such an ability to spontaneously maintain undetectable plasma viraemia is a major objective of HIV-1 cure research, but the characteristics of proviral reservoirs in elite controllers remain to be determined. Here, using next-generation sequencing of near-full-length single HIV-1 genomes and corresponding chromosomal integration sites, we show that the proviral reservoirs of elite controllers frequently consist of oligoclonal to near-monoclonal clusters of intact proviral sequences. In contrast to individuals treated with long-term antiretroviral therapy, intact proviral sequences from elite controllers were integrated at highly distinct sites in the human genome and were preferentially located in centromeric satellite DNA or in Kruppel-associated box domain-containing zinc finger genes on chromosome 19, both of which are associated with heterochromatin features. Moreover, the integration sites of intact proviral sequences from elite controllers showed an increased distance to transcriptional start sites and accessible chromatin of the host genome and were enriched in repressive chromatin marks. These data suggest that a distinct configuration of the proviral reservoir represents a structural correlate of natural viral control, and that the quality, rather than the quantity, of viral reservoirs can be an important distinguishing feature for a functional cure of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, in one elite controller, we were unable to detect intact proviral sequences despite analysing more than 1.5 billion peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which raises the possibility that a sterilizing cure of HIV-1 infection, which has previously been observed only following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation(2,3), may be feasible in rare instances.\")\n",

We assessed future HIV serological outcomes for individuals with indeterminate results and associated factors in Rakai, Uganda. METHODS: 115,944 serological results, defined by two enzyme immunoassay (EIAs), among 39,440 individuals aged 15-49 years in the Rakai Community Cohort Study were assessed. Indeterminate results were defined as contradictory EIAs. Modified Poisson regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to assess prevalence ratios (PRs) of subsequent HIV serological outcomes and factors associated with HIV indeterminate results. RESULTS: The prevalence of HIV serologically indeterminate results was 4.9%. Indeterminate results were less likely among women than men (adjPR 0.76, 95% CI 0.71,0.81), in unmarried participants than married participants (adjPR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85,99), and in individuals with primary (adjPR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80,1.02), secondary (adjPR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73,0.96) and post-secondary (adjPR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60,0.94) education, relative to no education.

A community pharmacy-based ART refill model was implemented where stable clients were devolved to community pharmacies for routine refills at a service fee, to promote private sector participation and sustainability of ART services. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of this model in Nigeria. METHODS: A population-based retrospective analysis of the community pharmacy ART refill program of the United States Agency for International Development-funded 'Strengthening Integrated Delivery of HIV/AIDS Services' project in Lagos, Rivers, Cross River and Akwa Ibom States from October 2016 to February 2018 was conducted. Standard descriptive statistical methods were used for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants. Outcomes were assessed using the Chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regressions model. Statistical significance was defined at alpha-level of 0.05. Analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows version 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, USA). RESULTS: A total of 10015 participants representing 14.4% of ART clients in 50 hospitals opted for this model and were devolved to 244 community pharmacies. All clients consented and paid a service fee of N1000 (about $3) per refill visit. Median follow-up duration was 6 months. Prescription refill rate was 95% (95% CI 94.2-95.3).

College-educated Black women are most likely to acquire HIV while in college, and there has been a marked absence of research assessing the environmental and cultural influences present throughout college-campuses, coupled with evaluating how these factors shape sexual behaviors. We conducted surveys with Black female students attending a historically Black college and Black female students attending a predominately White university, and compared baseline differences in sexual behaviors among both populations. Results showed that for participants attending the historically Black college certain sociocultural elements, such as music and media, had a significantly stronger influence on sexuality and sexual behaviors compared with students attending predominately White universities.

METHODS: Following the six steps of concept mapping, participants identified and rated factors they perceived to influence decisions to use PrEP among African American women. RESULTS: African American women generated a list of statements, and we grouped the statements into eight clusters: access, financial, best benefits, protection, medication, setbacks, network, and fear. HCPs ranked having an HIV-positive partner as the most influential factor that affected African American women's decisions to use PrEP (network cluster). African American women ranked ability to prevent HIV when condom use cannot be negotiated as their top reason (best benefits cluster) for using PrEP. CONCLUSION: African American women wanted to know how they could protect themselves and were open to using PrEP. For African American women considering the use of PrEP, the most influential factors were related to the benefits and accessibility of PrEP.

However, the effectiveness and safety of R-CHOP among DLBCL patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is less clear, as HIV+ patients were omitted from most clinical trials and population-level data from unselected patients are limited. R-CHOP was funded for HIV-associated DLBCL patients with CD4 >50/mm(3) in Ontario in February 2015. METHODS: Patients with a new diagnosis of DLBCL were identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry between April 2010 and March 2018.

The effect of rituximab and HIV on overall survival was assessed in the HIV+ subgroup (R-CHOP vs CHOP) and in the R-CHOP subgroup (HIV+ vs HIV-). RESULTS: Among HIV+ patients, receipt of R-CHOP was associated with a fivefold improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.29 (0.13-0.66) compared with CHOP), after adjustment. Among patients who received R-CHOP (n = 6106), older age, male sex, lower neighborhood income, and higher comorbidity were associated with worse overall survival, after adjustment (P < .001 for all), but HIV positivity was not prognostic (HR 1.12 (0.60-2.10)).

We evaluated PrEP uptake and retention in HIV hyperendemic fishing villages and trading centres in south-central Uganda between April 2018 and March 2019. METHODS: PrEP eligibility was assessed using a national risk screening tool. Programme data were used to evaluate uptake and retention over 12 months. Multivariable modified Poisson regression estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% Confidence intervals (CIs) of uptake associated with covariates. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate retention and multivariable Cox regression to estimate adjusted relative hazards (aRH) and 95% CIs of discontinuation associated with covariates. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of the 2985 HIV-negative individuals screened; 2750 (92.1 %) were eligible; of whom 2,536 (92.2%) accepted PrEP.

A comparative modeling study.\", \"['Bromberg DJ', 'Paltiel AD', 'Busch SH', 'Pachankis JE']\", '20200812', \"BACKGROUND: While advances in HIV prevention and treatment have changed the epidemic for gay and bisexual men, another epidemic faces this population. Gay and bisexual men represent one of the highest risk groups for depression, which potentially poses quality-of-life and public health challenges comparable to those of HIV. The present study seeks to inform comprehensive care for sexual minority men by estimating and comparing the morbidity of HIV and depression for US gay and bisexual men. METHODS: In 2018, weighted counts of gay and bisexual men living with HIV and depression were derived from the CDC's Medical Monitoring Project and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, respectively. Years lived with disability for HIV and depression were calculated using the Global Burden of Disease Study's disability weights. FINDINGS: Among gay and bisexual adult men in the US, the prevalence of past-year major depressive episodes is 14.17%, while the prevalence of HIV is 11.52%. We estimate that in calendar year 2015, major depressive episodes imposed 85,361 (95% CI 58,293-112,212) years lived with disability among US adult gay and bisexual men, whereas HIV posed 42,981 (95% CI 36,221-49,722) years lived with disability. INTERPRETATION: This analysis shows that depression morbidity currently exceeds that for HIV among US adult gay and bisexual men. While gay and bisexual men are frequently understood to be a high-risk population for HIV, including in guidelines for HIV prevention and treatment, the present analysis suggests that this population should also be considered high-risk for depression.\")\n",

In the general population, a treatment-resistant phenotype of depression is associated with systemic inflammation, which is of considerable importance as it responds favorably to anti-inflammatory medications. Aging PWH experience increasing inflammation. We sought to evaluate the impact of chronic inflammation in aging PWH on depressed mood. METHODS: PWH were recruited at 6 U.S. academic medical centers. Depressed mood was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II. Inflammatory biomarkers measured at the 12-year follow-up visit in blood plasma using immunoassays were neopterin, sTNFRII, d-dimer, IL-6, CRP, MCP-1, sCD14 and sCD40L. Factor analyses with oblique Equamax rotation were employed to reduce the dimensionality of the biomarkers. RESULTS: Participants were 78 PWH, 14 (17.9%) women, 40 (51.3%) non-White, mean age 55.3 (+/-SD 8.29), with a nadir and current CD4 of 134 (IQR 36, 204) and 567 (316, 797), respectively. 80.5% were virally suppressed. A factor analysis of the eight inflammatory biomarkers in plasma at the 12-year follow-up visit yielded 3 Factors, with Factor 1 loading on neopterin and sTNFRII, Factor 2 loading on d-dimer, IL-6 and CRP, and Factor 3 loading on sCD40L (MCP-1 and sCD14 did not appear in any of the factors). Univariate regressions of each factor vs BDI-II scores yielded significance only for Factor 2 (r \\u200b= \\u200b0.295; p \\u200b= \\u200b0.0083 (Bonferroni-adjusted p \\u200b= \\u200b0.0261). Of the Factor 2 component biomarkers, BDI-II scores correlated significantly with d-dimer and IL-6, but not CRP. Women had worse BDI-II scores (p \\u200b= \\u200b0.0127). In a logistic regression with sex and Factor 2, both variables were significant (sex p \\u200b= \\u200b0.0246, Factor 2 p \\u200b= \\u200b0.0168). The relationship between Factor 2 and BDI was significant for men (r \\u200b= \\u200b0.348 [95% CI 0.111, 0.547]; p \\u200b= \\u200b0.0049), but not women (r \\u200b= \\u200b0.0580 95% CI -0.488, 0.571]; p \\u200b= \\u200b0.844). Viral suppression was not significant in the multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: Some PWH with depressed mood have elevated markers of inflammation in blood. Men showed this relationship, while women did not. Together with previous findings that an inflammatory depression phenotype responds to treatment with anti-inflammatory medications, our findings suggest that treatment with anti-inflammatory medications might benefit at least a subset of depressed PWH who have a high inflammatory biomarker profile, as well as poor response to antidepressant medications alone, and that the pathophysiology of depression in men and women with HIV may differ.')\n",

However, few research training programs have systematically measured their impact on capacity building and most evaluations have been limited to reporting of individual trainee metrics. Hence, we conducted an evaluation of the impact of a five-year training program focused on building both trainee and institutional research capacity at a public medical college in India. METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to assess the individual and institutional research capacity building of a five-year HIV-TB research training program at Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College in Pune, India, supported by the US National Institutes of Health, Fogarty International Center. In addition to documentation of the number of trainee research projects initiated, the number of research papers produced by the Fogarty Scholars (FSs) available on PubMed was calculated. The institutional impact of this program was assessed by documentation of research training activities conducted by the FSs, as well as by surveys and in-depth interviews conducted at the beginning and end of the program. RESULTS: Twenty-one mid-level BJGMC faculty were provided training in HIV-TB research competencies.

METHODS: We conducted a double-blind randomized trial to compare the incidence of malaria during infancy among infants born to HIV-uninfected pregnant women who were randomized to monthly IPTp with either DP or SP. Infants were followed for all their medical care in a dedicated study clinic, and routine assessments were conducted every 4 weeks. At all visits, infants with fever and a positive thick blood smear were diagnosed and treated for malaria. The primary outcome was malaria incidence during the first 12 months of life. All analyses were done by modified intention to treat. RESULTS: Of the 782 women enrolled, 687 were followed through delivery from December 9, 2016, to December 5, 2017, resulting in 678 live births: 339 born to mothers randomized to SP and 339 born to those randomized to DP. Of these, 581 infants (85.7%) were followed up to 12 months of age. Overall, the incidence of malaria was lower among infants born to mothers randomized to DP compared to SP, but the difference was not statistically significant (1.71 vs 1.98 episodes per person-year, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-1.03, p = 0.11).

CONCLUSION: Despite the superiority of DP for IPTp, there was no evidence of a difference in malaria incidence during infancy in infants born to mothers who received DP compared to those born to mothers who received SP.

Four health clinics were paired with four substance use rehabilitation programs and randomized into four cycles. Women living with HIV and who use alcohol or other drugs were recruited into each cycle (n = 120 each cycle). We assessed adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, cost, and fidelity using a mixed methods approach. RESULTS: Adoption: 100 % of staff trained in the WHC and designated as interventionists delivered one or more workshops. Acceptability: Interventionists found the WHC content beneficial to their patients and the WHC improved connections between clinical units in facilities. Appropriateness: The WHC aligned with facility goals to improve antiretroviral adherence and reduce alcohol use; however, there were implementation challenges, including staff shortages, stigma, and few places to refer women for supportive services. Cost: The cost of implementing the WHC was 20.59 ZAR (1.40 USD) per attendee. Fidelity: Interventionists implemented the WHC with high fidelity and quality.

There were no donor transmissions from donors without known blood-borne viruses. An additional 68 recipients had new virus notifications, of whom 2/68 died, due to HBV infection. CONCLUSION: This work confirms the safety of organ donation in an Australian cohort, with no unrecognized viral transmissions and most donors with viral infections not transmitting the virus. This may support targeted increases in donation from donors with viral infections. However, other new virus notifications post transplant were substantial and are preventable.

Globally, 1.4 million pregnant women are estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS, the majority of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral treatment (ART) have been associated with increased rates of preterm birth, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Acute HIV infection is associated with a rapid depletion of all three subsets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), ILC1s, ILC2s and ILC3s, which is not reversed by ART. ILCs have been found at the maternal-fetal interface and we therefore investigated the potential association between maternal HIV infection, peripheral ILC frequencies and preterm birth. In our study of pregnant South African women with accurately dated pregnancies, we show that maternal HIV infection is associated with reduced levels of all three ILC subsets. Preterm birth was also associated with lower levels of all three ILC subsets in early pregnancy. ILC frequencies were lowest in HIV positive women who experienced preterm birth. Moreover, ILC levels were reduced in pregnancies resulting in spontaneous onset of preterm labour and in extreme preterm birth (< 28 weeks gestation). Our findings suggest that reduced ILC frequencies may be a link between maternal HIV infection and preterm birth. In addition, ILC frequencies in early pregnancy may serve as predictive biomarkers for women who are at risk of delivering preterm.')\n",

We evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of rapid ART initiation in the Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP). We aimed to establish whether simplified ART initiation with the offer of same-day treatment could increase uptake and reduce time from clinic linkage to treatment initiation, while maintaining rates of retention in care and viral suppression. METHODS: We did a quasi-experimental before and after study with use of data from the BCPP. The BCPP was a community-randomised HIV-prevention trial done in 30 communities across Botswana from Oct 1, 2013, to June 30, 2018. Participants in the 15 intervention clusters, who were HIV-positive and not already taking ART were offered universal HIV-treatment and same-day ART with a dolutegravir-based regimen at first clinic visit. This rapid ART intervention was implemented mid-way through the trial on June 1, 2016, enabling us to determine the effect of rapid ART guidelines on time to ART initiation and rates of retention in care and viral suppression at 1 year in the BCPP intervention group. FINDINGS: We assessed 1717 adults linked to study clinics before rapid ART introduction and 800 after rapid ART introduction. During the rapid ART period, 457 (57.1%, 95% CI 53.7-60.6) individuals initiated ART within 1 day of linkage, 589 (73.7%, 70.6-76.7) of 799 within 1 week, 678 (84.9%, 82.4-87.3) of 799 within 1 month, and 744 (93.5%, 91.6-95.1) of 796 within 1 year. Before the introduction of rapid ART, 163 (9.5%, 95% CI 8.2-11.0) individuals initiated ART within 1 day of linkage, 276 (16.1%, 14.4-17.9) within 1 week, 839 (48.9%, 46.5-51.3) within 1 month, and 1532 (89.2%, 87.7-90.6) within 1 year. 1 year after ART initiation, 1472 (90.5%, 87.4-92.8) of 1627 individuals who linked in the standard ART period were in care and had a viral load of less than 400 copies per mL, compared with 578 (91.6%, 88.1-94.1) of 631 in the rapid ART period (risk ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.92-1.11).

We sought to determine the viral tropism of subtype C (C-HIV) Envelope (Env) clones for different CD4(+) T cell subsets and whether tropism changes during acute to chronic disease progression. HIV-1 envs were amplified from the plasma of five C-HIV infected women from three untreated time points; less than 2 months, 1-year and 3-years post-infection. Pseudoviruses were generated from Env clones, phenotyped for coreceptor usage and CD4(+) T cell subset tropism was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: A total of 50 C-HIV envs were cloned and screened for functionality in pseudovirus infection assays. Phylogenetic and variable region characteristic analysis demonstrated evolution in envs between time points. We found 45 pseudoviruses were functional and all used CCR5 to mediate entry into NP2/CD4/CCR5 cells. In vitro infection assays showed transitional memory (TM) and effector memory (EM) CD4(+) T cells were more frequently infected (median: 46% and 25% of total infected CD4(+) T cells respectively) than naive, stem cell memory, central memory and terminally differentiated cells. This was not due to these subsets contributing a higher proportion of the CD4(+) T cell pool, rather these subsets were more susceptible to infection (median: 5.38% EM and 2.15% TM cells infected), consistent with heightened CCR5 expression on EM and TM cells. No inter- or intra-participant changes in CD4(+) T cell subset tropism were observed across the three-time points. CONCLUSIONS: CD4(+) T cell subsets that express more CCR5 were more susceptible to infection with C-HIV Envs, suggesting that these may be the major cellular targets during the first 3 years of infection. Moreover, we found that viral tropism for different CD4(+) T cell subsets in vitro did not change between Envs cloned from acute to chronic disease stages. Finally, central memory, naive and stem cell memory CD4(+) T cell subsets were susceptible to infection, albeit inefficiently by Envs from all time-points, suggesting that direct infection of these cells may help establish the latent reservoir early in infection.')\n",

This study evaluated whether chronic marijuana (MJ) use contributes to additional cognitive deficits or brain microstructural abnormalities that may reflect neuroinflammation or neuronal injury in HIV+. METHOD: Using a 2 x 2 design, 44 HIV+ participants [23 minimal/no MJ users (HIV+), 21 chronic active MJ users (HIV + MJ)] were compared to 46 seronegative participants [24 minimal/no MJ users (SN) and 22 chronic MJ users (SN + MJ)] on neuropsychological performance (7 cognitive domains) and diffusion tensor imaging metrics, using an automated atlas to assess fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD), radial (RD), and mean (MD) diffusivities, in 18 cortical and 4 subcortical brain regions. RESULTS: Compared to SN and regardless of MJ use, the HIV+ group had lower FA and higher diffusivities in multiple white matter and subcortical structures (p < 0.001-0.050), as well as poorer cognition in Fluency (p = 0.039), Attention/Working Memory (p = 0.009), Learning (p = 0.014), and Memory (p = 0.028). Regardless of HIV serostatus, MJ users had lower AD in uncinate fasciculus (p = 0.024) but similar cognition as nonusers. HIV serostatus and MJ use showed an interactive effect on mean diffusivity in the right globus pallidus but not on cognitive function. Furthermore, lower FA in left anterior internal capsule predicted poorer Fluency across all participants and worse Attention/Working Memory in all except SN subjects, while higher diffusivities in several white matter tracts also predicted lower cognitive domain Z-scores. Lastly, MJ users with or without HIV infection showed greater than normal age-dependent FA declines in superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule, and globus pallidus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, except in the globus pallidus, chronic MJ use had no additional negative influence on brain microstructure or neurocognitive deficits in HIV+ individuals. However, lower AD in the uncinate fasciculus of MJ users suggests axonal loss in this white matter tract that connects to cannabinoid receptor rich brain regions that are involved in verbal memory and emotion. Furthermore, the greater than normal age-dependent FA declines in the white matter tracts and globus pallidus in MJ users suggest that older chronic MJ users may eventually have lesser neuronal integrity in these brain regions.')\n",

Others with a rather devastating history and high fatality rates such as plague, cholera, or typhus seem less threatening today but have not been eradicated, and with a declining efficacy of current antibiotics they ought to be watched carefully. Another emerging issue in this context is health-care associated infection. About 100,000 hospitalized patients in the USA ( www.cdc.gov ) and 33,000 in Europe ( https://www.ecdc.europa.eu ) die each year as a direct consequence of an infection caused by bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Among viral infections, influenza is responsible for about 3-5 million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually ( www.who.int ). About 37 million people are currently living with HIV infection and about one million die from it each year. Coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, but in particular the recent outbreak of Covid-19 (caused by SARS-CoV2) have resulted in large numbers of infections worldwide with an estimated several hundred thousand deaths (anticipated fatality rate: <5%). With a comparatively low mortality rate dengue virus causes between 50 and 100 million infections every year, leading to 50,000 deaths. In contrast, Ebola virus is the causative agent for one of the deadliest viral diseases. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 is considered the largest outbreak in history with more than 11,000 deaths. Many of the deadliest pathogens such as Ebola virus, influenza virus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, dengue virus, and cholera exploit the endo-lysosomal trafficking system of host cells for penetration into the cytosol and replication. Defects in endo-lysosomal maturation, trafficking, fusion, or pH homeostasis can efficiently reduce the cytotoxicity caused by these pathogens. Most of these functions critically depend on endo-lysosomal membrane proteins such as transporters and ion channels. In particular, cation channels such as the mucolipins (TRPMLs) or the two-pore channels (TPCs) are involved in all of these aspects of endo-lysosomal integrity. In this review we will discuss the correlations between pathogen toxicity and endo-lysosomal cation channel function, and their potential as drug targets for infectious disease therapy.')\n",

As the number of adolescents living with HIV continues to increase globally, more information about adherence and retention patterns during and through transition from child- to adult-centered care is needed to ensure provision of a high level of care and inform development of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in this vulnerable population. In this analysis, we sought to describe long-term trends in adherence, retention, and virologic suppression in adolescents receiving ART at a pediatric HIV clinic in Nigeria through transition to the adult clinic. SETTING: The Jos University Teaching Hospital, United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-funded HIV clinic in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational longitudinal evaluation of data that had been collected during the course of care in a large pediatric ART program in Nigeria. We used descriptive statistics to define our patient population and quantify retention from ART initiation through adolescence and transition to adult-centered care. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of loss to follow-up. We used medication possession ratio (MPR) to quantify adherence for each year a patient was on ART. To evaluate adherence and virologic suppression, we measured the proportion of patients with >/=95% MPR and the proportion with virologic suppression (viral load </=400 copies/mL) within each age cohort, and used bivariate analyses to examine any association between MPR and VL suppression for all person-years observed. RESULTS: A total of 476 patients received at least one dose of ART as an adolescent (ages 10-19 years). The proportions of patients lost to follow-up were: 11.9% (71/597) prior to adolescence, 19.1% (31/162) during adolescence, and 13.7% (10/73) during transition to adult-centered care. While over 80% of patients had >/=95% medication adherence in all age groups, their viral load suppression rates through adolescence and post-transition were only 55.6%-64.0%. For patients that successfully transitioned to adult-centered care, we observed 87.7% (50/57) retention at month 12 post-transition, but only 34.6% (9/26) viral load suppression. CONCLUSIONS: Our evaluation found considerable proportions of adolescents lost to follow-up throughout the ART program cascade. We also found discrepancies between the proportions of patients with >/=95% MPR and the proportions with VL suppression, suggesting that true medication adherence in this population may be poor. Significant attention and targeted interventions to improve retention and adherence focused on adolescents are needed in order for global programs to achieve 90-90-90 goals.\")\n",

A considerable proportion of patients stop using 99DOTS during therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand reasons for variability in the acceptance and use of 99DOTS by TB patients and health care providers (HCPs). METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with individuals taking TB therapy in the government program in Chennai and Vellore (HIV-coinfected patients) and Mumbai (HIV-uninfected patients) across intensive and continuation treatment phases. We conducted interviews with HCPs who provide TB care, all of whom were involved in implementing 99DOTS. Interviews were transcribed, coded using a deductive approach, and analyzed with Dedoose 8.0.35 software (SocioCultural Research Consultants, LLC). The findings of the study were interpreted using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, which highlights 4 constructs associated with technology acceptance: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influences, and facilitating conditions. RESULTS: We conducted 62 interviews with patients with TB, of whom 30 (48%) were HIV coinfected, and 31 interviews with HCPs. Acceptance of 99DOTS by patients was variable. Greater patient acceptance was related to perceptions of improved patient-HCP relationships from increased phone communication, TB pill-taking habit formation due to SMS text messaging reminders, and reduced need to visit health facilities (performance expectancy); improved family involvement in TB care (social influences); and from 99DOTS leading HCPs to engage positively in patients' care through increased outreach (facilitating conditions). Lower patient acceptance was related to perceptions of reduced face-to-face contact with HCPs (performance expectancy); problems with cell phone access, literacy, cellular signal, or technology fatigue (effort expectancy); high TB- and HIV-related stigma within the family (social influences); and poor counseling in 99DOTS by HCPs or perceptions that HCPs were not acting upon adherence data (facilitating conditions). Acceptance of 99DOTS by HCPs was generally high and related to perceptions that the 99DOTS adherence dashboard and patient-related SMS text messaging alerts improve quality of care, the efficiency of care, and the patient-HCP relationship (performance expectancy); that the dashboard is easy to use (effort expectancy); and that 99DOTS leads to better coordination among HCPs (social influences). However, HCPs described suboptimal facilitating conditions, including inadequate training of HCPs in 99DOTS, unequal changes in workload, and shortages of 99DOTS medication envelopes. CONCLUSIONS: In India's government TB program, 99DOTS had high acceptance by HCPs but variable acceptance by patients. Although some factors contributing to suboptimal patient acceptance are modifiable, other factors such as TB- and HIV-related stigma and poor cell phone accessibility, cellular signal, and literacy are more difficult to address. Screening for these barriers may facilitate targeting of 99DOTS to patients more likely to use this technology.\")\n",

We fit joinpoint regression models to estimate the annual percentage change (APC), average APC, and changes in AADRs per billion US dollars in HIV funding, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For 19 data points, the number of joinpoints ranged from 0 to 4 on the basis of rules set by the program or by the user. A Monte Carlo permutation test indicated significant (P < .05) changes at joinpoints, and 2-sided t tests indicated significant APCs in AADRs. RESULTS: Domestic HIV funding increased from $10.7 billion in FFY 1999 to $26.3 billion in FFY 2017, but AADRs decreased at different rates for each racial/ethnic group.

When controlling for relevant covariates, both HIV serostatus and MetS were independently associated with greater apathy and executive dysfunction. HIV, but not MetS, was associated with greater disinhibition. The present findings suggest an additive effect of HIV and MetS on specific neurobehavioral disturbances (apathy and executive dysfunction), underscoring the importance of identifying and treating both HIV and MetS to lessen central nervous system burden among PLWH.\")\n",

Protection in BALB/c mice can be attributed to an unusually strong and protective MHC-1 L(d)-restricted CD8+ T cell response directed against a peptide derived from the parasite antigen GRA6. The MHC-1 L(d) molecule has limited peptide binding compared to conventional MHC molecules such as K(b) or D(b), which correlates with polymorphisms associated with \"elite control\" of HIV in humans. To investigate the link between the unusual MHC-1 molecule L(d) and the generation of \"elite controller\" CD8+ T cell responses, we compared the GRA6-L(d) specific T cell response to the well-studied OVA-K(b) specific response, and demonstrated that GRA6-L(d) specific T cells are significantly more protective and resistant to exhaustion in chronic T. gondii infection. To further investigate the connection between limited peptide presentation and robust T cell responses, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mice with a point mutation (W97R) in the peptide-binding groove of L(d) that results in broader peptide binding. We investigated the effect of this L(d) W97R mutation on another robust L(d)-restricted response against the IE1 peptide during Murine Cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. This mutation leads to an increase in exhaustion markers in the IE1-L(d) specific CD8+ T cell response. Our results indicate that limited peptide binding by MHC-1 L(d) correlates with the development of robust and protective CD8+ T cell responses that may avoid exhaustion during chronic infection.')\n",

Herein, we report a chemically functionalized conical shaped poly-(ethylene terephthalate) nanopore (PET nanopore) as a stochastic sensing element for detection of proteins at the single-molecule level. We demonstrate that the PET nanopore sensor is not only sensitive and selective, but also can differentiate proteins rapidly, offering the potential for label-free protein detection and characterization.

Black women are a viable population segment to consider for PrEP use as their HIV incidence is overwhelmingly higher than all other women groups. METHODS: We developed and piloted a cultural- and age- appropriate PrEP education intervention to determine Black college women's: 1) perceptions of and receptivity to PrEP use; and 2) preferences for PrEP information delivery. RESULTS: We recruited N = 43 Black college women. Most of our sample were sophomore and Juniors of whom identified as heterosexual (83%) and single (67%). Over 50% of young women had never been HIV tested and only 28% had been tested in the last 6 months; however, 100% of the women believed their HIV status was negative. Prior to participating in the study, most Black college women (67%) had not heard about PrEP and were unsure or apprehensive (72%) to initiate PrEP. The Black college women indicated that our educational intervention was extremely helpful (67%) for understanding and learning about PrEP. Post participating in our PrEP education module, regardless of delivery modality, participants reported being likely (62.55-70%) to initiate PrEP in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that Black college women would strongly consider PrEP when provided with basic knowledge, regardless of delivery modality. Participants also showed greater appreciation for in-person delivery and found it to be significantly more helpful and of greater quality for learning about PrEP; comprehension or perceived usefulness of PrEP-related content was relatively the same between groups.

METHODS: Demographic Projection (DemProj) and AIDS Impact Modules (AIM) of Spectrum 5.63 software recommended by the United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS Global Reference Group on HIV Estimates, Modelling and Projections, were used for generating HIV estimations on key indicators. HIV sentinel surveillance, epidemiological and programme data were entered into Estimation Projection Package (EPP), and curve fitting was done using EPP classic model. Finally, calibration was done using the State HIV prevalence of two rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) -3 and -4 and Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS), 2014-2015. RESULTS: The national adult prevalence of HIV was estimated to be 0.22 per cent in 2017. Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland had the highest prevalence over one per cent. An estimated 2.1 million people were living with HIV in 2017, with Maharashtra estimated to have the highest number. Of the 88 thousand annual new HIV infections estimated nationally in 2017, Telangana accounted for the largest share.

Although there is an aggregate decline of HIV diagnoses among women in the United States, there are persistent disparate rates of new HIV infections among Black women compared to any other cisgender female subgroup. Strategies to end the HIV epidemic-as outlined in the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative-for all communities must consider HIV prevention messaging and message delivery mediums that are created with community input. Although mobile health (mHealth) is a popular platform for delivering HIV interventions, there are currently no mobile apps that consider cisgender Black women with the goal of promoting a comprehensive women's reproductive health and HIV prevention lifestyle. Previous research recommends inclusion of the target population from project inception and iteratively throughout development, to promote use of the intervention. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to understand cisgender Black women's preferences for functionality, format, and design of a mobile HIV prevention app and to examine their willingness to use an app for HIV prevention. METHODS: We conducted a series of four focus groups with 23 Black cisgender women. Focus groups included discussion and demonstration elements to address cisgender women's general preference for apps, HIV prevention content that would be useful in an app, and preferred app features that would promote use of an HIV-centric app. During focus group discussions, participants were shown narrated, custom wireframes of HIV prevention app prototypes to demonstrate potential app function. RESULTS: Findings indicated the presence of eight subthemes within the coding structure of three overall themes: (1) health content within the mobile app, (2) mobile app functionality, format, and design, and (3) other suggested features. Specifically, participants detailed preferred educational content, content distribution, app aesthetics, privacy considerations, and marketing of the app. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that Black cisgender women preferred an app that integrated HIV prevention and optimal sexual health promotion. Participants provided a range of preferences for content integration and facilitators of app engagement with an HIV prevention app. Preferences centered on gender and cultural congruency of information and content, evidenced by visuals, language, and resources.

METHODS: We used hotspot enumeration and cross-sectional biobehavioral survey data from the 2015 Transition Study of AGYW aged 14-24 years who frequented hotspots in Mombasa, Kenya. We described the HIV cascade among young females who sell sex (YFSS) (N = 408) versus those young females who do not sell sex (YFNS) (N = 891) and triangulated the potential (100% test acceptance and accuracy) and feasible (accounting for test acceptance and sensitivity) number of AGYW that could be newly diagnosed through hotspot-based HIV rapid testing in Mombasa. We identified the profile of AGYW with an HIV in the past year using generalized linear mixed regression models. RESULTS: N = 37/365 (10.1%) YFSS and N = 30/828 (3.6%) YFNS were living with HIV, of whom 27.0% (N = 10/37) and 30.0% (N = 9/30) were diagnosed and aware (P = 0.79).

METHODS: Within an urban sexual health service testing predominantly men who have sex with men, a file review of RPR changes was undertaken in all subjects who had a dilution level of >/=1:4, between January 2015 to the end of December 2018. RESULTS: Overall, 248 cases of infectious syphilis were identified in 215 subjects (165 HIV seropositive, 50 HIV seronegative). Among unique-subject cases with follow-up RPR recorded, seroreversion to a non-reactive titre was achieved in only 42.3% (71/168) cases at a median of 235 days (interquartile range: 138-348 days) and was significantly less likely if patients had HIV infection (P = 0.02), late latent syphilis (P = 0.003) or a subsequent syphilis infection (P < 0.0001). Having HIV infection (P = 0.03) or a subsequent episode of syphilis (P = 0.01) were associated with a lower likelihood of documented cure. CONCLUSIONS: The slow decay in RPR titres post therapy and the inability of a significant number of subjects to achieve a non-reactive result over time makes RPR a poor test for assessing the adequacy of treatment or in diagnosing re-infection, especially in populations having repeated and frequent risk exposures.

Western Sydney has a culturally diverse population, with a high proportion of non-Australian-born individuals. This study describes the prevalence of TDR and non-B HIV-1 subtypes in a clinic-based population. METHODS: A clinic database was examined for all newly diagnosed treatment-naive HIV-1 patients and information on their HIV-1 resistance and subtype, demographics including country of birth and diagnosis of a bacterial sexually transmissible infection was collected. RESULTS: Data were available from 74/79 individuals (62 cis-male, 16 cis-female and 1 transgender woman). Of the 74 genotypes, the prevalence of non-B subtypes and TDR was 43/74 (58%; 95%CI = 46.9-69.3) and 14/74 (19%; 95%CI = 10.0 to 27.8).

OBJECTIVE: We report on the feasibility of visual inspection with acetic acid in the severely resource-limited Mwanza district and on the impact of intervening education on baseline human papillomavirus and cervical cancer knowledge. STUDY DESIGN: Two 5-day free visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) clinics in urban Buzuruga and rural Sangabuye on the shores of Lake Victoria were approved by our university institutional review board and local Tanzanian health authorities. Participants completed a demographic survey and a 6-question (1 point per question) multiple choice test written in Kiswahili to assess baseline knowledge.

Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the intracellular retention of FNC triphosphate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was markedly longer than that of the 3TC triphosphate. FNC selectively enters and is retained in HIV target cells, where it exerts long-lasting prevention of HIV-1 infection. In addition to inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcription, FNC also restores A3G expression in CD4(+) T cells in FNC-treated HIV-1 patients. FNC binds to the Vif-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, enabling A3G to avoid Vif-induced ubiquitination and degradation.

Rates of HIV testing are particularly low among AA and H/L MSM, and innovative approaches to encourage testing may help address high incidence in these men. HIV self-testing (HST) may be an important tool for increasing rates and frequency of testing. HST may be particularly well-suited for AA and H/L MSM, given that stigma and mistrust of medical care contribute to low testing rates. Despite its promise, however, many are concerned that HST does not sufficiently connect users with critical post-testing resources, such as confirmatory testing and care among those who test positive, and that these limitations may result in delayed linkage to care. METHODS: We developed a mobile health platform (eTest) that monitors when HST users open their tests in real time, allowing us to provide timely, \"active\" follow-up counseling and referral over the phone. In this study, 900 high-risk MSM (with targets of 40% AA, 35% H/L) who have not tested in the last year will be recruited from social media and other gay-oriented websites in several major cities.

Primary outcomes include rates of HIV testing, receipt of additional HIV prevention services, and PrEP initiation verified by clinical medical records. DISCUSSION: This study tests whether providing more active counseling and referral after HST encourages more regular HIV testing and engagement with other prevention services among MSM, compared to more passive approaches or clinic-based testing alone.

METHODS: We calculated the proportion of the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort who were virally suppressed each year, 2010-2018, based on different denominators; thresholds for suppression (</=20, </=50, </=200, or </=400 copies/ml); and strategies for summarizing multiple viral load measurements (we classified persons as suppressed if they had any lab, >/=50% of labs, last lab, or all labs below the threshold). We also calculated 5-year risk of all-cause mortality associated with each classification of viral suppression. RESULTS: Three thousand eleven persons contributed 60 858 viral load values to this analysis. Proportion classified as virally suppressed ranged from 51.8 to 92.5%, depending on the definition used and persons included in the calculation. Requiring more labs below the threshold; using a lower threshold; and assuming persons lost to follow-up were not suppressed (stricter definitions) resulted in a lower proportion estimated to be suppressed.

METHODS: In this single-arm, open-label study, HIV-positive adults who had undetectable plasma HIV RNA load (<50 copies/ml) for 6 months or longer while receiving co-formulated TDF, FTC, and 600-mg EFV with EFV C12 of >/=1 mg/L were enrolled. The participants were switched to co-formulated TDF, 3TC, and 400-mg EFV and followed for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with EFV C12 >/= 1 mg/L at Week 4. The secondary endpoints included virologic response and change of CD4 lymphocyte count up to Week 24. Specific adverse effects associated with EFV were recorded before and after the switch. RESULTS: From December 2018 to January 2019, 50 participants were enrolled. EFV C12 remained >/=1 mg/L in 48 (96.0%) participants with a median reduction of 38.9% (interquartile range 29.0-44.4) at Week 4 after switch.

In resource-constrained settings, pharmacological smoking cessation interventions are unfeasible because of their high cost. There is a need to develop and evaluate behavioural interventions to address the unique challenges of tobacco use in the HIV-infected populations in these settings. OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Behavioural Activation/Problem Solving for Smoking Cessation (BAPS-SC) intervention programme to determine whether it should be tested in an adequately powered randomised controlled trial. METHOD: The authors merged behavioural activation therapy (BAT) with the principles of problem-solving therapy to create a novel five-session counselling model to address the unique challenges of tobacco cessation amongst those infected with HIV. Feasibility measures included the rate of enrolment amongst those eligible and the retention rate and descriptive analysis of intervention acceptability. The authors' secondary outcome was 7-day point smoking prevalence abstinence, confirmed with breath carbon monoxide. RESULTS: A total of 128 individuals were screened over 8 weeks with 50 deemed eligible and 40 enrolled (80%). Retention at week 12 was 53% (21/40). The 7-day point prevalence abstinence, co-confirmed, at week 12 was 37.5% (15/40). All respondents indicated that they would recommend BAPS-SC to other smokers who want to quit, and would be willing to participate in the programme again up to the point of exit if they did not stop smoking. CONCLUSION: A full-scale randomised control trial comparing BAPS-SC with usual practice is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of this novel intervention in these settings.\")\n",

Most studies have focused on the direct causes of stillbirth. The aim of this study was to determine the association between antenatal care utilization and quality with stillbirth in a Kenyan set up. This information is key when planning strategies to reduce the stillbirth burden. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a case-control study in four urban tertiary hospitals carried out between August 2018 and April 2019. A total of 214 women with stillbirths (cases) and 428 with livebirths (controls) between 28 and 42 weeks were enrolled. Information was obtained through interviews and data abstracted from medical records. Antenatal care utilization was assessed by the proportions of women not attending antenatal care; booking first antenatal care visit in first trimester and not making the requisite four antenatal care visits. Quality of antenatal care was assessed using individual surrogate indicators (antenatal profile testing, weight/blood pressure/urinalysis testing in each antenatal visit, utilization of early obstetric ultrasound, completeness of antenatal records) and a codified indicator made up of seven parameters (attending antenatal care, booking first antenatal care in the first trimester, making four or more antenatal visits, having all antenatal profile tests, having a complete antenatal record, having blood pressure and weight measured at all visits). The association between antenatal care utilization and quality with stillbirth was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis using logistic regression. Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed P value </= .05. RESULTS: Women with stillbirth were likely to have a parity >/=4 (19.6% vs 12.6%, P = .02), have an obstetric complication (36% vs 8.6%, P = .001) and have a medical disorder (5.6% vs 1.6%, P = .01). The odds of a stillbirth were four times higher among those who did not attend antenatal care ( odds ratio [OR] 4.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-10, P < .003). Compared with four antenatal care visits, those who had one or two visits had higher odds of a stillbirth: OR 2.96 (95% CI 1.4-6.1), P = .003, and OR 2.9 (95% CI 1.7-5), P = .003, respectively. As per the individual surrogate indicators, the likelihood of a stillbirth was lower in women who received good quality antenatal care: Hemoglobin testing (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.8, P = .03), blood group test (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.6, P < .001), HIV test (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, P = .001), venereal disease research laboratory test (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.4, P = .001), weight measurement (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0, P = .047). As per the composite indicator, the quality of antenatal care was poor across the board and there was no association between this surrogate indicator and stillbirth. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of antenatal care, attending fewer than four antenatal visits and poor quality antenatal care as measured by surrogate indicators were significantly associated with stillbirth. In addition, women with low education level, obstetric complications, multiparity and medical complications had a significantly higher likelihood of stillbirth. Improving the utilization of four or more antenatal visits and the quality of antenatal care can reduce the risk of stillbirth.')\n",

One class of these drugs are non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) that target the viral reverse transcriptase (RT). First generation NNRTIs were troubled with poor pharmacological properties and drug resistance, incentivizing the development of improved compounds. One class of developed compounds are the 2-naphthyl phenyl ethers, showing promising efficacy against the Y181C RT mutation. Further biochemical and structural work demonstrated differences in potency against the Y181C mutation and binding mode of the compounds. This work aims to understand the relationship between the binding mode and ability to overcome drug resistance using macromolecular x-ray crystallography. Comparison of 2-naphthyl phenyl ethers bound to Y181C RT reveal that compounds that interact with the invariant W229 are more capable of retaining efficacy against the resistance mutation. Additional modifications to these compounds at the 4-position, computationally designed to compensate for the Y181C mutation, do not demonstrate improved potency.

We evaluated the effect and acceptance of an aVCT cascade program among Taiwanese individuals by surveying 572 participants (mean age: 29.6 years; 99.3% men; and 79.5% same-sex sexual contact) diagnosed with HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) from 2015 to 2019. We designed a five-stage continuum based on acceptance of the program before HIV diagnosis: at high risk of HIV infection (Stage 1), heard of aVCT (Stage 2), wants to receive aVCT (Stage 3), has received aVCT (Stage 4), and regularly receives aVCT (Stage 5). Four domains established from exploratory factor analysis described reasons for inability to reach the next aVCT stage: low perceived HIV risk, fear of testing positive because of discrimination/stigmatization, and structural barriers to aVCT. Regular aVCT (vs. never receiving aVCT) protected against AIDS on diagnosis (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in program acceptance across 2015-2019. However, uptake reduced markedly across the program; the largest reduction (37.4.0-61.0%) occurred from Stage 4 to Stage 5. Fear of testing positive because of discrimination/stigmatization was the main reason for not proceeding to the next aVCT stage.

METHODS: All HIV-positive patients seeking care at a university hospital in Taiwan tested for anti-HCV IgG at least once annually to estimate the incidence of HCV seroconversion during 2011-2018. HCV genotyping and sequencing were performed and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with HCV seroconversion among MSM. FINDINGS: During the study period, 3495 HCV-seronegative patients (86.4% MSM) were included and 294 (8.4%) with recent HCV infection were identified, in whom 281 (95.6%) were MSM, during a total of 16,361.86 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), giving an overall incidence rate of 17.97 per 1000 PYFU, which increased from 14.28 per 1000 PYFU in 2011 to 25.38 per 1000 PYFU in 2018 (p<0.001). HCV seroconversion among MSM was associated with aspartate aminotransferase >/=37 U/L (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 7.50, 95% CI 4.17-13.50), alanine aminotransferase >/=41 U/L (AOR 7.47, 95% CI 4.11-13.58), and syphilis acquisition (AOR 2.88, 95% CI 1.67-4.97).

Yet, there is a dearth of evidence-based treatment options that can address both unhealthy alcohol use and comorbidities in SSA HIV care settings. Recent studies testing single-session alcohol brief interventions (BIs) among PLWH in SSA have suggested that more robust treatments are needed. This paper describes the protocol of a pilot randomized controlled superiority trial that will test the effectiveness of an evidence-based transdiagnostic multi-session psychotherapy, the Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), compared to a control condition consisting of a single session brief alcohol intervention (BI) based on CETA, at reducing unhealthy alcohol use, mental health problems, and other substance use among PLWH in urban Zambia. METHODS: The study is a single-blind, parallel, individually randomized trial conducted in HIV treatment centers in Lusaka. 160 PLWH who meet criteria for unhealthy alcohol use + mental health or substance use comorbidities and/or have a more severe alcohol use disorder are eligible. Participants are randomized 1:1 to receive the single-session BI or CETA. Outcomes are assessed at baseline and a six-month follow-up and include unhealthy alcohol use, depression, trauma symptoms, and other substance use. CONCLUSIONS: The trial is a first step in establishing the effectiveness of CETA at reducing unhealthy alcohol use and comorbidities among PLWH in SSA.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: A community-based sample of 437 adults (330 men, mean [SD] age 40.6 [11.2] years) living in Vancouver, Canada, completed baseline assessments between November 2008 and October 2015. Follow-up was monthly for a median 6.3 years (interquartile range 3.1-8.6). Use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, methamphetamine, and opioids was assessed by interview and urine drug screen; severity of psychosis was also assessed. Mortality (up to November 15, 2018) was assessed from coroner\\'s reports and hospital records. Using data from monthly visits (mean 9.8, SD 3.6) over the first year after study entry, mixed-effects logistic regression analysis examined relationships between risk factors and psychotic features. A past history of psychotic disorder was common (60.9%). Nonprescribed substance use included tobacco (89.0%), alcohol (77.5%), cocaine (73.2%), cannabis (72.8%), opioids (51.0%), and methamphetamine (46.5%). During the same year, 79.3% of participants reported psychotic features at least once. Greater risk was associated with number of days using methamphetamine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.24, p = 0.001), alcohol (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18, p = 0.04), and cannabis (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14, p = 0.008), adjusted for demographic factors and history of past psychotic disorder. Greater exposure to concurrent month trauma was associated with increased odds of psychosis (adjusted model aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.19-2.00, p = 0.001). There was no evidence for interactions or reverse associations between psychotic features and time-varying risk factors. During 2,481 total person years of observation, 79 participants died (18.1%). Causes of death were physical illness (40.5%), accidental overdose (35.4%), trauma (5.1%), suicide (1.3%), and unknown (17.7%). A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model indicated baseline alcohol dependence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.09-3.07, p = 0.02), and evidence of hepatic fibrosis (aHR 1.81, 95% CI 1.08-3.03, p = 0.02) were risk factors for mortality. Among those under age 55 years, a history of a psychotic disorder was a risk factor for mortality (aHR 2.38, 95% CI 1.03-5.51, p = 0.04, adjusted for alcohol dependence at baseline, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and hepatic fibrosis). The primary study limitation concerns generalizability: conclusions from a community-based, diagnostically heterogeneous sample may not apply to specific diagnostic groups in a clinical setting. Because one-third of participants grew up in foster care or were adopted, useful family history information was not obtainable. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found methamphetamine, alcohol, and cannabis use were associated with higher risk for psychotic features, as were a past history of psychotic disorder, and experiencing traumatic events. We found that alcohol dependence, hepatic fibrosis, and, only among participants <55 years of age, history of a psychotic disorder were associated with greater risk for mortality.

In China many people living with HCV are unaware of their hepatitis status and not connected to care and treatment. Crowdsourcing is a technique that invites the public to create health promotion materials and has been found to increase HIV testing uptake, including in China. This trial aims to evaluate crowdsourcing as a strategy to improve HCV awareness, testing and linkage-to-care in China. METHODS: A randomized controlled, two-armed trial (RCT) is being conducted in Shenzhen with 1006 participants recruited from primary care sectors of The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital. Eligible participants are >/=30 years old; a resident in Shenzhen for at least one month after recruitment; no screening for HCV within the past 12 months and not known to have chronic HCV; and, having a WeChat social media account. Allocation is 1:1. Both groups will be administered a baseline and a follow-up survey (4-week post-enrollment). The intervention group will receive crowdsourcing materials to promote HCV testing once a week for two weeks and feedback will be collected thereafter, while the control group will receive no promotional materials. Feedback collected will be judged by a panel and selected to be implemented to improve the intervention continuously. Those identified positive for HCV antibodies will be referred to gastroenterologists for confirmation and treatment. The primary outcome will be confirmed HCV testing uptake, and secondary outcomes include HCV confirmatory testing and initiation of HCV treatment with follow-ups with specialist providers. Data will be collected on Survey Star(@) via mobile devices. DISCUSSION: This will be the first study to evaluate the impact of crowdsourcing to improve viral hepatitis testing and linkage-to-care in the health facilities. This RCT will contribute to the existing literature on interventions to improve viral hepatitis testing in primary care setting, and inform future strategies to improve HCV care training for primary care providers in China.

The Zambian urban adherence club (AC) is a health service innovation designed to improve on-time drug pickup and retention in HIV care through off-hours facility access and pharmacist-led group drug distribution. Similar models of differentiated service delivery (DSD) have shown promise in South Africa, but observational analyses of these models are prone to bias and confounding. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of ACs in Zambia using a more rigorous study design. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a matched-pair cluster randomized study design (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02776254), 10 clinics were randomized to intervention (5 clinics) or control (5 clinics). At each clinic, between May 19 and October 27, 2016, a systematic random sample was assessed for eligibility (HIV+, age >/= 14 years, on ART >6 months, not acutely ill, CD4 count not <200 cells/mm3) and willingness to participate in an AC. Clinical and antiretroviral drug pickup data were obtained through the existing electronic medical record. AC meeting attendance data were collected at intervention facilities prospectively through October 28, 2017. The primary outcome was time to first late drug pickup (>7 days late). Intervention effect was estimated using unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox proportional hazards model to derive an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR). Medication possession ratio (MPR) and implementation outcomes (adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and fidelity) were additionally evaluated as secondary outcomes. Baseline characteristics were similar between 571 intervention and 489 control participants with respect to median age (42 versus 41 years), sex (62% versus 66% female), median time since ART initiation (4.8 versus 5.0 years), median CD4 count at study enrollment (506 versus 533 cells/mm3), and baseline retention (53% versus 55% with at least 1 late drug pickup in previous 12 months). The rate of late drug pickup was lower in intervention participants compared to control participants (aHR 0.26, 95% CI 0.15-0.45, p < 0.001). Median MPR was 100% in intervention participants compared to 96% in control participants (p < 0.001). Although 18% (683/3,734) of AC group meeting visits were missed, on-time drug pickup (within 7 days) still occurred in 51% (350/683) of these missed visits through alternate means (use of buddy pickup or early return to the facility). Qualitative evaluation suggests that the intervention was acceptable to both patients and providers. While patients embraced the convenience and patient-centeredness of the model, preference for traditional adherence counseling and need for greater human resources influenced intervention appropriateness and feasibility from the provider perspective. The main limitations of this study were the small number of clusters, lack of viral load data, and relatively short follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: ACs were found to be an effective model of service delivery for reducing late ART drug pickup among HIV-infected adults in Zambia. Drug pickup outside of group meetings was relatively common and underscores the need for DSD models to be flexible and patient-centered if they are to be effective.

DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of HEU infants in a prospective cohort study of mother-infant pairs. METHODS: Infants were recruited from immunization clinics (n = 151) in Zimbabwe from February to August 2013, enrolled at 4-12 weeks age, and followed every 3 months until incident HIV-infection, death, or 18-month follow-up. We estimated cumulative mortality probability and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression, respectively. We also described reported reasons for infant hospitalization and symptoms preceding death. Median weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) and median age were calculated and analyzed across study visits. RESULTS: Of 1188 HIV-exposed infants, 73 (6.1%) contracted HIV; we analyzed the remaining 1115 HEU infants. In total, 54 (4.8%) infants died, with median time to death of 5.5 months since birth (interquartile range: 3.6-9.8 months). Diarrhea, difficulty breathing, not eating, fever, and cough were commonly reported (range: 7.4-22.2%) as symptoms preceding infant death. Low birth weight was associated with higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.66, CI: 1.35-5.25), whereas maternal antiretroviral therapy predelivery (adjusted hazard ratio 0.34, CI: 0.18-0.64) and exclusive breastfeeding (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, CI: 0.28-0.91) were associated with lower mortality. Overall, 9.6% of infants were hospitalized. Infant median WAZ declined after 3 months of age, reaching a minimum at 14.5 months of age, at which 50% of infants were underweight (WAZ below -2.0).

Maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral treatment (ART) increase the rate of preterm birth, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, limiting progress in prediction, prevention and treatment. While overall gammadelta T cell levels remain constant, acute HIV infection is associated with a depletion of the Vdelta2 subset and an increase in the Vdelta1 subset, which do not return to baseline with ART. gammadelta T cells have also been implicated in adverse pregnancy outcomes and we therefore investigated the potential association between maternal HIV infection, peripheral gammadelta T cell frequencies and preterm birth. METHODS: Study participants were HIV positive (n = 47) and HIV negative (n = 45) women enrolled in a prospective pregnancy cohort study at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, South Africa. Women were enrolled in early pregnancy and gestational age was accurately determined by first trimester ultrasound scan. Peripheral blood samples were collected in each trimester and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated. Frequencies of gammadelta T cells, Vdelta1+ and Vdelta2+ gammadelta T cell subsets, and CCR6 chemokine receptor expression were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Total gammadelta T cell levels were similar between HIV positive and HIV negative women throughout pregnancy. However, in each trimester maternal HIV infection was associated with reduced levels of the Vdelta2+ subset and increased levels of the Vdelta1+ subset, leading to a reversal of the Vdelta1/Vdelta2 ratio. Timing of ART initiation among HIV positive women did not affect levels of gammadelta T cells, the Vdelta1+ and Vdelta2+ subsets, or the Vdelta1/Vdelta2 ratio. Importantly, preterm birth was associated with lower total gammadelta T cell levels in early pregnancy and gammadelta T cell frequencies were lowest in HIV positive women who delivered preterm. Moreover, in the first trimester the proportion of Vdelta1+ T cells that were CCR6+ was significantly reduced in HIV+ women and women who delivered preterm, resulting in the lowest proportion of CCR6+ Vdelta1 T cells in HIV positive women who delivered preterm. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that altered gammadelta T cell frequencies may link maternal HIV infection and preterm birth. gammadelta T cell frequencies in early pregnancy may serve as predictive biomarkers to identify women at risk of delivering preterm.')\n",

We present an analysis of cross-sectional ZIMPHIA data, highlighting PLHIV with AD and concurrent viral load suppression (VLS). METHODS: ZIMPHIA collected blood specimens for HIV testing from 22,501 consenting adults (ages 15 years and older); 3,466 PLHIV had CD4 and VL results. Household HIV testing used the national serial algorithm, and those testing positive then received point-of-care CD4 enumeration with subsequent VL testing. We used logistic regression analysis to explore factors associated with concurrent AD and VLS (<1000 copies/mL). All analyses were weighted to account for complex survey design. RESULTS: Of the 3,466 PLHIV in the survey with CD4 and VL results, 17% were found to have AD (CD4<200cells/mm3). Of all AD patients, 30% had VLS. Concurrent AD and VLS was associated with male sex (aOR 2.45 95%CI 1.61-3.72), older age (35-49 years [aOR 2.46 95%CI 1.03-5.91] and 50+ years [aOR 4.82 95%CI 2.02-11.46] vs 15-24 years), and ART duration (<6 months [aOR 0.46 95%CI 0.29-0.76] and 6-24 months [aOR 2.07 95%CI 1.35-3.17] vs more than 2 years). The relationship between sex and AD is driven by age with significant associations among men aged 25-34, (aOR 3.37 95%CI 1.35-8.41), 35-49 (aOR 5.13 95%CI 2.16-12.18), and 50+ (aOR 12.56 95%CI 4.82-32.72) versus men aged 15-24. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of PLHIV with AD and VLS illustrates the conundrum of decreased support for CD4 monitoring, as these patients may not receive appropriate clinical services for advanced HIV disease.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for condom use to compare pregnancy incidence during both perfect and typical (i.e., allowing temporary interruptions) use. RESULTS: A total of 7710 women contributed to this analysis. Seventy pregnancies occurred during perfect and 85 during typical use. There was no statistically significant difference in perfect use pregnancy incidence among the methods: 0.61 per 100 woman-years for DMPA-IM [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.96], 1.06 for copper IUD (95% CI 0.72-1.50) and 0.63 for LNG implants (95% CI 0.39-0.96).

METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial data among male and female antiretroviral treatment patients with hazardous alcohol use in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam. Analyses were restricted to male participants who were married/cohabitating (N = 313). Alcohol use was assessed as proportion days alcohol abstinent, heavy drinking, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) using the Timeline Followback and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview questionnaire. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate the effects of higher versus lower average alcohol use on IPV perpetration (between-person effects) and the effects of time-specific deviations in alcohol use on IPV perpetration (within-person effects).

Despite the importance of HIV testing services (HTS) in HIV control, uptake of HTS among female sex workers (FSWs) across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains sub-optimal. Concerns about stigma associated with sex work and fear of loss of livelihood if HIV status becomes known, are some of the restrictions for FSWs to utilize HTS offered through health care facilities. Introduction of HIV self-testing (HIVST) may mitigate some of the barriers for the uptake of HTS. This study explored the acceptability of FSWs towards the introduction of HIVST in Tanzania. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory study employing in-depth interviews (IDI) and participatory group discussions (PGD) with FSWs in selected regions of Tanzania. Study participants were recruited through snowball sampling. Data were thematically analysed by two analysts using NVivo software. The analysis was informed by the social-ecological model and focused on factors associated with the acceptability of HIVST. RESULTS: We conducted 21 PGD sessions involving 227 FSWs. Twenty three IDIs were conducted to complement data collected through PGD. Our study has demonstrated that FSWs are enthusiastic toward HIVST. Convenience (time and cost saved), and belief that HIVST will increase privacy and confidentiality motivated participants' support for the self-testing approach. Participants did express concerns about their ability to interpret and trust the results of the test. Participants also expressed concern that HIVST could cause personal harm, including severe distress and self-harm for individuals with a reactive test. Very likely, concern about adverse effects of HIVST was linked to the study participants' lay perception that HIVST would be provided only through unassisted modality. CONCLUSIONS: FSWs demonstrated high enthusiasm to use the HIVST once it becomes available. Expectations for increased confidentiality, autonomy, and reduced opportunity costs were among the leading factors that attracted FSWs to HIVST. The major obstacles to the acceptability of HIVST included fear of HIV reactive test and not trusting self-diagnoses. Our findings underscore the importance of providing adequate access to counselling and referral services in conjunction with HIVST.\")\n",

To test this approach, we designed vaccines comprised of protein immunogens fused to an immunodominant CD4(+) T cell epitope of the secreted Ag 85B protein of BCG. Proof-of-concept experiments showed that the presence of BCG-specific Th cells in previously BCG-vaccinated mice had a dose-sparing effect for subsequent vaccination with fusion proteins containing the Ag 85B epitope and consistently induced isotype switching to the IgG2c subclass. Studies using an Ebola virus glycoprotein fused to the Ag 85B epitope showed that prior BCG vaccination promoted high-affinity IgG1 responses that neutralized viral infection. The design of fusion protein vaccines with the ability to recruit BCG-specific CD4(+) Th cells may be a useful and broadly applicable approach to generating improved vaccines against a range of established and newly emergent viral pathogens.')\n",

We sought to determine whether a community-based intervention to identify and rapidly treat people living with HIV, and support male circumcision could increase population levels of HIV diagnosis, treatment, viral suppression, and male circumcision in Botswana. METHODS: The Ya Tsie Botswana Combination Prevention Project study was a pair-matched cluster-randomised trial done in 30 communities across Botswana done from Oct 30, 2013, to June 30, 2018. 15 communities were randomly assigned to receive HIV prevention and treatment interventions, including enhanced HIV testing, earlier antiretroviral therapy (ART), and strengthened male circumcision services, and 15 received standard of care. The first primary endpoint of HIV incidence has already been reported. In this Article, we report findings for the second primary endpoint of population uptake of HIV prevention services, as measured by proportion of people known to be HIV-positive or tested HIV-negative in the preceding 12 months; proportion of people living with HIV diagnosed and on ART; proportion of people living with HIV on ART with viral suppression; and proportion of HIV-negative men circumcised. A longitudinal cohort of residents aged 16-64 years from a random, approximately 20% sample of households across the 15 communities was enrolled to assess baseline uptake of study outcomes; we also administered an end-of-study survey to all residents not previously enrolled in the longitudinal cohort to provide study end coverage estimates. Differences in intervention uptake over time by randomisation group were tested via paired Student's t test. The study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01965470). FINDINGS: In the six communities participating in the end-of-study survey, 2625 residents (n=1304 from standard-of-care communities, n=1321 from intervention communities) were enrolled into the 20% longitudinal cohort at baseline from Oct 30, 2013, to Nov 24, 2015. In the same communities, 10 791 (86%) of 12 489 eligible enumerated residents not previously enrolled in the longitudinal cohort participated in the end-of-study survey from March 30, 2017, to Feb 25, 2018 (5896 in intervention and 4895 in standard-of-care communities). At study end, in intervention communities, 1228 people living with HIV (91% of 1353) were on ART; 1166 people living with HIV (88% of 1321 with available viral load) were virally suppressed, and 673 HIV-negative men (40% of 1673) were circumcised in intervention communities. After accounting for baseline differences, at study end the proportion of people living with HIV who were diagnosed was significantly higher in intervention communities (absolute increase of 9% to 93%) compared with standard-of-care communities (absolute increase of 2% to 88%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.08 [95% CI 1.02-1.14], p=0.032). Population levels of ART, viral suppression, and male circumcision increased from baseline in both groups, with greater increases in intervention communities (ART PR 1.12 [95% CI 1.07-1.17], p=0.018; viral suppression 1.13 [1.09-1.17], p=0.017; male circumcision 1.26 [1.17-1.35], p=0.029). INTERPRETATION: It is possible to achieve very high population levels of HIV testing and treatment in a high-prevalence setting. Maintaining these coverage levels over the next decade could substantially reduce HIV transmission and potentially eliminate the epidemic in these areas.

However, they require large numbers of cells and are technically challenging. This justifies the need for the development of novel simplified methods adapted for small biological samples. Herein, we sought to simplify the viral outgrowth procedure (VOP) by (i) using memory CD4(+) T-cells, documented to be enriched in HIV reservoirs (ii) optimizing cell-culture conditions, and (iii) supplementing with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a positive regulator of HIV replication. Memory CD4(+) T-cells were sorted from the peripheral blood of ART-treated (HIV+ART; n = 14) and untreated (HIV+; n = 5) PLWH. The VOP was first performed with one original replicate of 1 x 10(6) cells/well in 48-well plates. Cells were stimulated via CD3/CD28 for 3 days, washed to remove residual CD3/CD28 Abs, split every 3 days for optimal cell density, and cultured in the presence or the absence of ATRA for 12 days. Soluble and intracellular HIV-p24 levels were quantified by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. Optimal cell-culture density achieved by splitting improved HIV outgrowth detection. ATRA promoted superior/accelerated detection of replication-competent HIV in all HIV+ART individuals tested, including those with low/undetectable viral outgrowth in the absence of ATRA. Finally, this VOP was used to design a simplified ATRA-based QVOA by including 4 and 6 original replicates of 1 x 10(6) cells/well in 48-well plates and 2 x 10(5) cells/well in 96-well plates, respectively. Consistently, the number of infectious units per million cells (IUPM) was significantly increased in the presence of ATRA. In conclusion, we demonstrate that memory CD4(+) T-cell splitting for optimal density in culture and ATRA supplementation significantly improved the efficacy of HIV outgrowth in a simplified ATRA-based QVOA performed in the absence of feeder/target cells or indicator cell lines.')\n",

For many participants, engagement in the Max Clinic was the first time they had success with HIV treatment. Relationships with clinic staff and the ability to receive care on a walk-in basis had the strongest influences on engagement. Participants felt that Max Clinic staff attended to their social circumstances in ways that were distinct from prior care experiences. Walk-in visits removed perceived stigma associated with failure to keep appointments and provided immediate attention to acute concerns. Financial incentives initially motivated participants to attend clinic and take medications, but were less important for supporting ongoing engagement in care. Food incentives motivated patients to seek care and helped them focus on health issues.

To help inform the implementation of the framework, we estimated the burden of vulnerabilities related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs related to health and gender equality) and program contact among YSW. METHODS: We used data from Transitions, a 2015 bio-behavioural cross-sectional survey of 408 YSW aged 14-24 years in Mombasa, Kenya. We estimated the prevalence of sexual (inconsistent condom use), structural (financial, violence), and reproductive health vulnerabilities; and characterized engagement with local HIV programs tailored to sex workers. We then compared the prevalence of vulnerabilities by age group (14-18 years, N = 117; 19-24 years, N = 291) and by program contact (ever contacted by local program for sex workers). RESULTS: 47.3% reported inconsistent condom use with any partner in the previous week (no difference by age-group, p = 1.00). Structural vulnerabilities were common and did not vary by age: 83.6% did not have a regular source of income; 29.9 and 29.2% had experienced physical and sexual violence, respectively. 26.5% reported at least one pregnancy before age 18, and 18.5% used a non-reliable form of contraception with little variability by age. 25.7% were aware of at least one program, and only 13.7% of YSW had ever been contacted by a program (8.5% of those aged 14-18 years; and 15.8% of those aged 19-24 years, p = 0.06).

A broader approach integrates contraceptive promotion with HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and management, alcohol awareness, gender-based violence and rights, and health care utilization. The Women's Health Intervention using SMS for Preventing Pregnancy (WHISPER) mobile phone intervention uses a participatory development approach and behavior change theory to address these high-priority concerns of FSWs in Mombasa, Kenya. OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to (1) describe the process of development of the WHISPER intervention, its theoretical framework, key content domains and strategies and (2) explore workshop participants' responses to the proposed intervention, particularly with regard to message content, behavior change constructs, and feasibility and acceptability. METHODS: The research team worked closely with FSWs in two phases of intervention development. First, we drafted content for three different types of messages based on a review of the literature and behavior change theories. Second, we piloted the intervention by conducting six workshops with 42 FSWs to test and refine message content and 12 interviews to assess the technical performance of the intervention. Workshop data were thematically analyzed using a mixed deductive and inductive approach. RESULTS: The intervention framework specified six SRHR domains that were viewed as highly relevant by FSWs. Reactions to intervention content revealed that social cognitive strategies to improve knowledge, outcome expectations, skills, and self-efficacy resonated well with workshop participants. Participants found the content empowering, and most said they would share the messages with others. The refined intervention was a 12-month SMS program consisting of informational and motivational messages, role model stories portraying behavior change among FSWs, and on-demand contraceptive information. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for health promotion interventions that incorporate broader components of SRHR, not only HIV prevention. Using a theory-based, participatory approach, we developed a digital health intervention that reflects the complex reality of FSWs' lives and provides a feasible, acceptable approach for addressing SRHR concerns and needs. FSWs may benefit from health promotion interventions that provide relevant, actionable, and engaging content to support behavior change.\")\n",

Such approaches draw on deep-rooted historical traditions of indigenous groups in combination with imported traditions which emerged from colonial engagement. To date, no review has sought to map the locations, health issues, art forms and methods documented by researchers using arts-based approaches in SSA. METHODS: Using scoping review methodology, 11 databases spanning biomedicine, arts and humanities and social sciences were searched. Researchers screened search results for papers using predefined criteria. Papers included in the review were read and summarised using a standardised proforma. Descriptive statistics were produced to characterise the location of the studies, art forms used or discussed, and the health issues addressed, and to determine how best to summarise the literature identified. RESULTS: Searches identified a total of 59 794 records, which reduced to 119 after screening. We identified literature representing 30 (62.5%) of the 48 countries in the SSA region. The papers covered 16 health issues. The majority (84.9%) focused on HIV/AIDS-related work, with Ebola (5.0%) and malaria (3.3%) also receiving attention.

For unknown reasons, the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which infects both domestic and wild cats, encodes a non-consensus myristoylation sequence not utilized by its host or by other mammals (most commonly: M(1)GNGQG). To explore the evolutionary basis for this sequence, we compared the structure, dynamics, and myristoylation properties of native FIV MA with a mutant protein containing a consensus feline myristoylation motif (MA(NOS)) and examined the impact of MA mutations on virus assembly and ability to support spreading infection. Unexpectedly, myristoylation efficiency of MA(NOS) in Escherichia coli by co-expressed mammalian NMT was reduced by ~70% compared to the wild-type protein. NMR studies revealed that residues of the N-terminal myristoylation signal are fully exposed and mobile in the native protein but partially sequestered in the MA(NOS) chimera, suggesting that the unusual FIV sequence is conserved to promote exposure and efficient myristoylation of the MA N terminus. In contrast, virus assembly studies indicate that the MA(NOS) mutation does not affect virus assembly, but does prevent virus spread, in feline kidney cells. Our findings indicate that residues of the FIV myristoylation sequence play roles in replication beyond NMT recognition and Gag-membrane binding.')\n",

Rehabilitation is well positioned to address disability and maximize healthy aging. An international collaborative network, called the Canada-International HIV and Rehabilitation Research Collaborative (CIHRRC), works to guide this emerging field. In this article, we report findings from CIHRRC's aim to identify emerging research priorities in HIV, aging and rehabilitation from the perspectives of people living with HIV, clinicians, researchers, representatives from community organizations and policy stakeholders. METHODS: We conducted a multi-stakeholder multi-method international consultation with people living with HIV, researchers, clinicians and representatives of community-based organizations to identify research priorities in HIV, aging and rehabilitation. Stakeholders identified research priorities during a one-day International Forum comprised of presentations and facilitated discussion. We collated and analyzed data using content analytical techniques, resulting in a framework of research priorities. RESULTS: Sixty-nine stakeholders from countries including Canada (n = 62; 90%), the United Kingdom (n = 5; 7%), United States (n = 1; 1%) and Australia (n = 1; 1%) attended the International Forum on HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation Research. Stakeholders represented community-based organizations (n = 20; 29%), academic institutions (n = 18; 26%), community or institutional healthcare organizations (n = 11; 16%), research or knowledge production organizations (n = 10; 14%), and organizations representing government or industry (n = 10; 14%). The Framework of Research Priorities in HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation includes seven research priorities: (1) nature, extent and impact of disability, concurrent health conditions and chronic inflammation with HIV; (2) prevalence, severity and impact of frailty; (3) community and social participation aging with HIV; (4) strategies for chronic disease management and healthy aging with HIV; (5) facilitators and barriers to access and engagement in, rehabilitation; (6) effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for healthy aging with HIV; and (7) advancing development and use of patient reported outcome measures in HIV and aging.

A common complaint seen in the ED is a sore throat. While most sore throats are easily diagnosed and treated, less common causes are often not considered in the differential diagnoses. Therefore, the purpose of this case study was to present an atypical case of sore throat and discuss differential diagnoses. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 45-year-old female who presented to the ED with a three-day history of sore throat that was exacerbated by eating and drinking. The patient was not on any prescription medications, but tried over-the-counter medications for the sore throat without any improvement in symptoms. Review of systems was positive for sore throat, fevers, and chills. Physical examination of her oropharynx revealed mildly dry mucous membranes with confluent plaques and white patchy ulcerative appearance involving the tongue, tonsils, hard palate, and soft palate. Rapid streptococcal antigen, mononucleosis spot test, and KOH test were performed and found to be negative. DISCUSSION: After initial testing was negative, a follow-up complete blood count with differential and complete metabolic profile were ordered. The patient was found to have decreased lymphocytes and platelets. Based upon those results, a diagnosis was made in the ED, the patient was started on medication, and further laboratory workup was ordered to confirm the diagnosis. ED providers should consider non-infectious as well as infectious causes for a sore throat, as this might lead to a diagnosis of an underlying condition.')\n",

In 2015, Public Health Seattle and King County partnered with the University of Washington Medicine to implement a real-time data exchange to identify virally unsuppressed people living with HIV seen at the ED/IP hospital and reengage them in HIV care. We evaluated the impact of the data exchange on care engagement and viral suppression. METHODS: Public Health Seattle and King County received a text alert on weekdays 8 AM to 6 PM for ED/IP patients previously diagnosed with HIV with a most recent viral load >/=200 copies/mL. We compared viral load testing <3 months and viral suppression <6 months after an alert-eligible visit in the 2 years after intervention and the 7 to 30 months before intervention. To account for secular trends, we used difference-in-differences models to compare patients with alert-window visits to patients with visits outside the alert window before and after intervention. RESULTS: Patients with visits within the alert window in the postintervention period were 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.20) times more likely to have a viral load test within 3 months after an ED visit/IP admission and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.27-1.76) times more likely to achieve viral suppression within 6 months than patients in the preintervention period. However, care engagement (difference-in-differences relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.84-1.18) and viral suppression (difference-in-differences relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84-1.20) trends were similar among patients with visits outside the alert window. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time data exchange with ED/IP hospitals was associated with improved viral suppression, but not increased care engagement.

Few studies have tested minority stressors' associations with PrEP engagement among high-HIV risk young MSM (YMSM). Therefore, we assessed the associations between PrEP-indicated YMSM's progression along the PrEP continuum and their experiences of minority stress. N = 229 YMSM completed a web-survey on PrEP-related behaviors and minority stress. Adjusted for covariates, we developed two partial-proportional odds models examining the associations between PrEP continuum progression and minority stressors, as a composite, and community homophobia, sexuality-related discrimination, and internalized homonegativity, respectively. Our multivariable model demonstrated minority stress levels to be negatively associated with PrEP continuum location (AOR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.58-0.99). Broken down, discrimination was positively associated with reporting being at an advanced location along the continuum (AOR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.06-1.82). Internalized homonegativity was negatively associated with continuum location between PrEP-aware participants with no intention to initiate and participants who intended to initiate PrEP (AOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.27-0.77) and between those who intended to initiate and those who had ever used PrEP (AOR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.22-0.69). Our findings suggest that minority stress, especially internalized homonegativity, remains a barrier to PrEP among PrEP-indicated YMSM. Sexuality-related discrimination was associated with PrEP continuum progression, suggesting potentially well-developed, adaptive coping skills (e.g., ability to locate sexuality-affirming providers). Coupled with stigma reduction efforts, HIV prevention services aiming to promote PrEP should incorporate internalized homonegativity screenings and referrals into sexuality-affirming resources for PrEP-indicated YMSM.\")\n",

Evidence in animal models have shown that markers of intestinal permeability and microbial translocation vary over the course of the day and are affected by food intake and circadian rhythms. However, daily variations of these markers are not characterized yet in PLWH. Herein, we assessed the variation of these markers over 24 h in PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a well-controlled environment. METHODS: As in Canada, PLWH are predominantly men and the majority of them are now over 50 years old, we selected 11 men over 50 receiving ART with undetectable viremia for more than 3 years in this pilot study. Blood samples were collected every 4 h over 24 h before snacks/meals from 8:00 in the morning to 8:00 the next day. All participants consumed similar meals at set times, and had a comparable amount of sleep, physical exercise and light exposure. Plasma levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and fungal (1-->3)-beta-D-Glucan (BDG) translocation markers, along with markers of intestinal damage fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and regenerating islet-derived protein-3alpha (REG3alpha) were assessed by ELISA or the fungitell assay. RESULTS: Participants had a median age of 57 years old (range 50 to 63). Plasma levels of BDG and REG3alpha did not vary significantly over the course of the study. In contrast, a significant increase of LPS was detected between 12:00 and 16:00 (Z-score: - 1.15 +/- 0.18 vs 0.16 +/- 0.15, p = 0.02), and between 12:00 and 24:00 (- 1.15 +/- 0.18 vs 0.89 +/- 0.26, p < 0.001). The plasma levels of I-FABP at 16:00 (- 0.92 +/- 0.09) were also significantly lower, compared to 8:00 the first day (0.48 +/- 0.26, p = 0.002), 4:00 (0.73 +/- 0.27, p < 0.001) or 8:00 on secondary day (0.88 +/- 0.27, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Conversely to the fungal translocation marker BDG and the gut damage marker REG3alpha, time of blood collection matters for the proper evaluation for LPS and I-FABP as markers for the risk of inflammatory non-AIDS co-morbidities.

METHODS: SHINE was a community-based cluster-randomized trial of improved infant feeding and/or improved water, sanitation and hygiene. Pregnant women were enrolled between 2012 and 2015. We assessed ECD in a sub-study at 24 months of age, between 2016 and 2017, using the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT; assessing motor, cognitive, language and social development); MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) (assessing vocabulary and grammar); A-not-B test (assessing object permanence); and a self-control task. Mothers and infants were tested longitudinally for HIV. We used generalized estimating equations to compare ECD scores between CHEU and CHU, accounting for the cluster-randomized design. Primary results were adjusted for trial-related factors that could affect measurement reliability of ECD: study nurse, age of child, calendar month of birth, sex and randomized arm. RESULTS: A total of 205 CHEU and 1175 CHU were evaluated. Mean total MDAT score was 90.6 (SD 8.7) in CHEU compared to 92.4 (9.1) in CHU (adjusted mean difference -1.3, 95% CI: -2.3, -0.3), driven mostly by differences in gross motor (-0.5, 95% CI: -0.9, -0.2) and language scores (-0.6, 95% CI: -1.1, -0.1). There was evidence that fine motor scores were lower in CHEU (adjusted mean difference -0.4, 95% CI: -0.8, 0.0) but no evidence of a difference in social scores (0.1, 95% CI: -0.2, 0.4).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reported on 22 BCG-vaccinated SCID patients who had received conditioned allogeneic HSCT with TCRalphabeta+/CD19+ graft depletion. All BCG-vaccinated patients received anti-mycobacterial therapy pre- and post-HSCT. Post-transplant immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus in 10 patients and of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (d-1, + 14, + 28) and 10 mg/kg abatacept (d-1, + 5, + 14, + 28) in 11 patients. RESULTS: Twelve patients, five of whom had BCG infection prior to HSCT, developed BCG-related inflammatory syndromes (BCG-IS). Five developed early BCG-IS with the median time of manifestation 11 days after HSCT, corresponding with a dramatic increase of CD3+TCRgammadelta+ in at least two patients. Early BCG-IS was noted in only one out of 11 patients who received tocilizumab/abatacept and 4 out of 11 patients who did not. Seven patients developed late BCG-IS which corresponded to T cell immune recovery; at the time of manifestation (median 4.2 months after HSCT), the median number of CD3+ cells was 0.42 x 10(9)/ and CD3+CD4+ cells 0.27 x 10(9)/l. In all patients, late BCG-IS was controlled with IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: BCG-vaccinated SCID patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT with TCRalphabeta+/CD19+ graft depletion are at an increased risk of early and late BCG-IS.

We collected Vpu isolates from 332 treatment-naive individuals living with chronic HIV-1 infection in Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, and Canada. Together, these Vpu isolates represent four major HIV-1 group M subtypes (A [n = 63], B [n = 84], C [n = 94], and D [n = 59]) plus intersubtype recombinants and uncommon strains (n = 32).

Overall, the median CD4 downregulation function of natural Vpu isolates was similar to that of NL4.3 (1.01 [interquartile range IQR, 0.86 to 1.18]), while the median tetherin downregulation function was moderately lower than that of NL4.3 (0.90 [0.79 to 0.97]). Both Vpu functions varied significantly among HIV-1 subtypes (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.0001). Specifically, subtype C clones exhibited the lowest CD4 and tetherin downregulation activities, while subtype D and B clones were most functional for both activities. We also identified Vpu polymorphisms associated with CD4 or tetherin downregulation function and validated six of these using site-directed mutagenesis. Our results highlight the marked extent to which Vpu function varies among global HIV-1 strains, raising the possibility that natural variation in this accessory protein may contribute to viral pathogenesis and/or spread.IMPORTANCE The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu enhances viral spread by downregulating CD4 and BST-2/tetherin on the surface of infected cells. Natural variability in these Vpu functions may contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis, but this has not been investigated among the diverse viral subtypes that contribute to the HIV-1 pandemic. In this study, we found that Vpu function differs significantly among HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, and D. On average, subtype C clones displayed the lowest ability to downregulate both CD4 and tetherin, while subtype B and D clones were more functional. We also identified Vpu polymorphisms that associate with functional differences among HIV-1 isolates and subtypes. Our study suggests that genetic diversity in Vpu may play an important role in the differential pathogenesis and/or spread of HIV-1.')\n",

We conducted 19 qualitative in-depth interviews with these women living in Sichuan, China. Semi-structured interviews were recorded and transcribed. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis. We found that these women utilized multiple coping strategies both within the family and externally. Coping strategies within the family included keeping husbands' HIV diagnosis confidential, integrating husband's HIV treatment management into family routines, restoring spousal relationship, protecting themselves from HIV infection, denying, self-blaming, and persuading the husbands to see the psychiatrist due to homosexual behaviors. Coping strategies outside the family included seeking information from multiple sources, peer support, and online support. Participants expressed needs for more information, psychological support, stigma reduction, and special counseling on how to handle their husband's homosexual identity and/or behavior. Women married to MSM living with HIV develop both adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies, and the majority of these women's needs are unmet under the current service system in China.\")\n",

The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has supported > 18,900,000 voluntary medical male circumcisions (VMMC). Glans injuries (GIs) are rare but devastating adverse events (AEs) that can occur during circumcision. To address this issue, PEPFAR has supported multiple interventions in the areas of surveillance, policy, education, training, supply chain, and AE management. METHODS: Since 2015, PEPFAR has conducted surveillance of GIs including rapid investigation by the in-country PEPFAR team. This information is collected on standardized forms, which were reviewed for this analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-six GIs were reported from 2015 to 2018; all patients were < 15 years old (~ 0.7 per 100,000 VMMCs in this age group) with a decreasing annual rate (2015: 0.7 per 100,000 VMMCs; 2018: 0.4 per 100,000 VMMC; p = 0.02). Most (64%) GIs were partial or complete amputations. All amputations among 10-14 year-olds occurred using the forceps-guided (FG) method, as opposed to the dorsal-slit (DS) method, and three GIs among infants occurred using a Mogen clamp. Of 19 attempted amputation repairs, reattached tissue was viable in four (21%) in the short term. In some cases, inadequate DS method training and being overworked, were found. CONCLUSION: Following numerous interventions by PEPFAR and other stakeholders, GIs are decreasing; however, they have not been eliminated and remain a challenge for the VMMC program. Preventing further cases of complete and partial amputation will likely require additional interventions that prevent use of the FG method in young patients and the Mogen clamp in infants. Improving management of GIs is critical to optimizing outcomes.\")\n",

METHOD: 39 HIV+ (21 men, 18 women) and 45 seronegative (SN, 20 men, 25 women) participants were assessed with brain diffusion tensor imaging and cognitive assessments (7 neuropsychological domains). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were measured with an automated atlas in selected brain regions. Group comparisons were assessed with linear mixed effects models, with sub-regions and hemisphere (left/right) as repeated factors for each region. RESULTS: HIV+ women, but not HIV+ men, were slower than sex-matched SN controls on sensorimotor function (Dominant-hand: interaction-p = 0.007; Non-dominant hand: interaction-p = 0.039). Similarly, only HIV+ women had lower FA in the globus pallidus (GP, interaction-p = 0.011). Additionally, regardless of sex, the HIV+ group had poorer Fluency, Speed, and Attention than SN-controls (p = 0.006-0.008), as well as lower FA and higher MD in multiple brain regions (p = <0.001-0.044).

Detecting and quantifying these HIV-1-specific CTL responses will be crucial for developing vaccine and T cell-based immunotherapies. A recently developed assay, called MANAFEST, uses T cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta sequencing of peptide-stimulated cultures followed by a bioinformatic pipeline to identify neoantigen-specific T cells in cancer patients.

Current therapeutic drugs use the nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) as a competitive inhibitor against HBV reverse transcriptase (HBV-RT), an essential enzyme pivotally involved in viral replication. Unfortunately, this treatment still causes the development of resistant variants of HBV against NAs. As HBV-RT is homologous to the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT), it is reasonable to treat HBV-RT with anti-HIV drugs. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the structural dynamics and susceptibility of the known anti-HIV drugs (stavudine [d4T], didanosine [DDI], and zidovudine [ZDV]) against HBV-RT enzyme in comparison to the anti-HBV drug lamivudine (3TC) and deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) substrate using several computational approaches. The DeltaGbindresidue calculations revealed that seven polar residues (K32, R41, D83, S85, D205, N236, and K239) and three hydrophobic residues (A86, A87, and F88) of HBV-RT as well as the adjacent DNA strands play an important role in the ligand binding. In addition, the H-bond pattern of d4T is similar to that of 3TC, especially at the residues A86 and A87. Such interactions promote the favorable conformation of ligand in the HBV-RT binding pocket, while the several different conformations of ligand are found in the unbound state. The predicted binding free energy results based on QM/MM-GBSA and MM/GB(PB)SA methods suggested that the susceptibility towards HBV-RT of d4T and ZDV is higher than that of 3TC and dTTP.

One strategy to increase elicited neutralization breadth involves vaccine priming of immune responses against a target site of vulnerability, followed by vaccine boosting of these responses with prefusion-closed Env trimers. This strategy has succeeded at the fusion peptide (FP) site of vulnerability in eliciting cross-clade neutralizing responses in standard vaccine-test animals. However, the breadth and potency of the elicited responses have been less than optimal. Here, we identify three mutations (3mut), Met302, Leu320, and Pro329, that stabilize the apex of the Env trimer in a prefusion-closed conformation and show antigenically, structurally, and immunogenically that combining 3mut with other approaches (e.g., repair and stabilize and glycine-helix breaking) yields well-behaved clade C-Env trimers capable of boosting the breadth of FP-directed responses. Crystal structures of these trimers confirmed prefusion-closed apexes stabilized by hydrophobic patches contributed by Met302 and Leu320, with Pro329 assuming canonically restricted dihedral angles. We substituted the N-terminal eight residues of FP (FP8, residues 512 to 519) of these trimers with the second most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v2, AVGLGAVF) and observed a 3mut-stabilized consensus clade C-Env trimer with FP8v2 to boost the breadth elicited in guinea pigs of FP-directed responses induced by immunogens containing the most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v1, AVGIGAVF). Overall, 3mut can stabilize the Env trimer apex, and the resultant apex-stabilized Env trimers can be used to expand the neutralization breadth elicited against the FP site of vulnerability.IMPORTANCE A major hurdle to the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is the elicitation of serum responses capable of neutralizing circulating strains of HIV, which are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and often highly neutralization resistant. Recently, we showed how sera with 20 to 30% neutralization breadth could, nevertheless, be elicited in standard vaccine test animals by priming with the most prevalent N-terminal 8 residues of the HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP8), followed by boosting with a stabilized BG505-envelope (Env) trimer. Here, we show that subsequent boosting with a 3mut-apex-stabilized consensus C-Env trimer, modified to have the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, elicits higher neutralization breadth than that induced by continued boosting with the stabilized BG505-Env trimer. With increased neutralizing breadth elicited by boosting with a heterologous trimer containing the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, the fusion peptide-directed immune-focusing approach moves a step closer toward realizing an effective HIV-1 vaccine regimen.')\n",

Using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected, long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated rhesus macaques, we demonstrate that PD-1, CTLA-4 and dual CTLA-4/PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade using monoclonal antibodies is well tolerated, with evidence of bioactivity in blood and lymph nodes. Dual blockade was remarkably more effective than PD-1 blockade alone in enhancing T cell cycling and differentiation, expanding effector-memory T cells and inducing robust viral reactivation in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In lymph nodes, dual CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade, but not PD-1 alone, decreased the total and intact SIV-DNA in CD4(+) T cells, and SIV-DNA and SIV-RNA in B cell follicles, a major site of viral persistence during ART. None of the tested interventions enhanced SIV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses during ART or viral control after ART interruption. Thus, despite CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade inducing robust latency reversal and reducing total levels of integrated virus, the degree of reservoir clearance was still insufficient to achieve viral control.

METHODS: We examined data from 1546 HIV-positive and 843 HIV-negative veterans. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and past-year antidepressant use was determined from Veterans Affair pharmacy records. Monocyte (soluble CD14 [sCD14]), inflammatory (interleukin-6 [IL-6]), and coagulation (D-dimer) marker levels were determined from previously banked blood specimens. Linear regression models with multiple imputation were run to estimate the associations between depression-related factors and CVD-relevant biomarkers. RESULTS: Among HIV-positive participants, greater somatic depressive symptoms were associated with higher sCD14 (exp[b] = 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00-1.03) and D-dimer (exp[b] = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.00-1.11) after adjustment for demographics and potential confounders. Further adjustment for antidepressant use and HIV factors slightly attenuated these relationships. Associations were also detected for antidepressant use, as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use was related to lower sCD14 (exp[b] = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91-1.00) and IL-6 (exp[b] = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.76-0.96), and tricyclic antidepressant use was related to higher sCD14 (exp[b] = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03-1.12) and IL-6 (exp[b] = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.02-1.28). Among HIV-negative participants, total, cognitive/affective, and somatic depressive symptoms were associated with higher IL-6, and tricyclic antidepressant use was related to higher sCD14.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) may cause systemic inflammation and immune activation that may impair brain function. We assessed cognition and biomarkers of inflammation in both HIV+ and HIV- South Indians with and without LTBI. METHODS: Adults (>/=18 years old) with and without HIV infection were screened for LTBI by interferon-gamma release assays, completed comprehensive neurocognitive assessments, and underwent measurement of serum inflammatory biomarker levels. RESULTS: The participants (n = 119) were HIV+/LTBI+ (n = 15), HIV+/LTBI- (n = 50), HIV-/LTBI+ (n = 26), and HIV-/LTBI- (n = 28). HIV+ participants, regardless of LTBI status, had more impaired global deficit scores than HIV- participants (odds ratio = 3.42, P = 0.028, adjusted for sex and education differences). Neither global deficit scores nor impairment rates differed in the LTBI+ group compared with the LTBI- group (P = 0.79 and P = 0.41, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the prevalence and risk factors of genitourinary C.trachomatis infection among patients attending STD clinics in northern Peninsular Malaysia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in STD clinics of Hospital Pulau Pinang and Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Kedah from January to November 2014. Participants were individually interviewed using a structured data collection form followed by a physical examination and laboratory tests. Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) was used to detect C.trachomatis infection. Analysis was carried out using SPSS Version 15. RESULTS: Eighty-three sexually active patients were enrolled, consisting of 51 males and 32 females. The median age was 28.0 years. In general, 32.5% patients were asymptomatic, the remaining presented with genital discharge (41.0%), genital warty lesion (25.3%), genital ulcer (13.3%), dysuria (13.3%), dyspareunia (2.4%), urine hesistancy (1.2%) and genital swelling (1.2%).

METHODS: We used 2012-2017 data from Rhode Island's APCD and developed an algorithm to identify individuals prescribed FTC/TDF for PrEP. We describe PrEP implementation by patient demographics and provider type and mapped PrEP implementation across ZIP codes. We compared APCD data to electronic medical record data and comprehensive pharmaceutical claims data (AIDSVu.org). RESULTS: The Rhode Island APCD represented approximately 87% of the state's population. PrEP use increased 31-fold from 2012 to 2017. Users were predominantly privately insured, male, and concentrated in Providence County (76.6%). Infectious diseases providers had 3.2 times the odds of being a PrEP prescriber compared to primary care providers.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective strategy that reduces the risk of HIV acquisition; however, uptake among those who can benefit from it has lagged. In this study, we 1) compared the characteristics of patients who were prescribed PrEP with individuals newly diagnosed with HIV infection, 2) identified the specialties of practitioners prescribing PrEP, 3) identified metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) within the US where there is relatively low uptake of PrEP, and 4) reported median amounts paid by patients and third-party payors for PrEP. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed prescription drug claims for individuals prescribed PrEP in the Integrated Dataverse (IDV) from Symphony Health for the period of September 2015 to August 2016 to describe PrEP patients, prescribers, relative uptake, and payment methods in the US. Data were available for 75,839 individuals prescribed PrEP, and findings were extrapolated to approximately 101,000 individuals, which is less than 10% of the 1.1 million adults for whom PrEP was indicated. Compared to individuals with newly diagnosed HIV infection, PrEP patients were more likely to be non-Hispanic white (45% versus 26.2%), older (25% versus 19% at ages 35-44), male (94% versus 81%), and not reside in the South (30% versus 52% reside in the South).Using a ratio of the number of PrEP patients within an MSA to the number of newly diagnosed individuals with HIV infection, we found MSAs with relatively low uptake of PrEP were concentrated in the South. Of the approximately 24,000 providers who prescribed PrEP, two-thirds reported primary care as their specialty. Compared to the types of payment methods that people living with diagnosed HIV (PLWH) used to pay for their antiretroviral treatment in 2015 to 2016 reported in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV Surveillance Special Report, PrEP patients were more likely to have used commercial health insurance (80% versus 35%) and less likely to have used public healthcare coverage or a publicly sponsored assistance program to pay for PrEP (12% versus 45% for Medicaid). Third-party payors covered 95% of the costs of PrEP. Overall, we estimated the median annual per patient out-of-pocket spending on PrEP was approximately US$72. Limitations of this study include missing information on prescription claims of patients not included in the database, and for those included, some patients were missing information on patient diagnosis, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and income (34%-36%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that in 2015-2016, many individuals in the US who could benefit from being on PrEP were not receiving this HIV prevention medication, and those prescribed PrEP had a significantly different distribution of characteristics from the broader population that is at risk for acquiring HIV. PrEP patients were more likely to pay for PrEP using commercial or private insurance, whereas PLWH were more likely to pay for their antiretroviral treatment using publicly sponsored programs. Addressing the affordability of PrEP and otherwise promoting its use among those with indications for PrEP represents an important opportunity to help end the HIV epidemic.')\n",

While unexplored in vivo, AlloP may confer protection against the neurological dysfunction associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The HIV-1 regulatory protein, trans-activator of transcription (Tat), is neurotoxic and its expression in mice increases anxiety-like behavior; an effect that can be ameliorated by progesterone, but not when 5alpha-reduction is blocked. Given that Tat's neurotoxic effects involve mitochondrial dysfunction and can be worsened with opioid exposure, we hypothesized that Tat and/or combined morphine would perturb steroidogenesis in mice, promoting neuronal death, and that exogenous AlloP would rescue these effects. Like other models of neural injury, conditionally inducing HIV-1 Tat in transgenic mice significantly increased the central synthesis of pregnenolone and progesterone's 5alpha-reduced metabolites, including AlloP, while decreasing central deoxycorticosterone (independent of changes in plasma). Morphine significantly increased brain and plasma concentrations of several steroids (including progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and their metabolites) likely via activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis. Tat, but not morphine, caused glucocorticoid resistance in primary splenocytes. In neurons, Tat depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential and increased cell death. Physiological concentrations of AlloP (0.1, 1, or 10 nM) reversed these effects. High-concentration AlloP (100 nM) was neurotoxic in combination with morphine. Tat induction in transgenic mice potentiated the psychomotor effects of acute morphine, while exogenous AlloP (1.0 mg/kg, but not 0.5 mg/kg) was ameliorative. Data demonstrate that steroidogenesis is altered by HIV-1 Tat or morphine and that physiological AlloP attenuates resulting neurotoxic and psychomotor effects.\")\n",

Women with PTB and Sp-PTL also had a higher proportion of CD8(+) MAIT cells in the first trimester compared to women without these outcomes. The association between changes in MAIT cell subsets and PTB/Sp-PTL was present in both HIV+ and HIV- women, and an additive effect on MAIT cell subsets was seen in women with both HIV infection and PTB. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between HIV-related and pregnancy-related changes in MAIT cell subsets and distribution may lead to imbalances in peripheral MAIT cell subsets in early pregnancy. This may contribute to the increased risk of PTB in HIV+ patients by altering the overall functionality of the peripheral MAIT cell compartment.')\n",

However, LGB people's experiences of health care in non-European and non-American settings have been scarcely studied. In China, while it has been estimated that there are at least 70 million gender and sexual minorities, there has been no larger-scale study on LGB people's experiences of health care beyond a focus on gay men and HIV. This study is the first larger-scale quantitative study to investigate LGB people's experiences of health care in China, where non-heterosexuality is officially silenced and the needs of non-heterosexual people are largely ignored by service providers. METHODS: An online survey was designed in joint partnership by academic, community groups and the United Nations Development Programme. Targeted and snowball sampling was adopted for participant recruitment. Such unique cross-sectoral partnership made this research possible in the authoritarian state of China where data collection on LGB people is extremely rare. For the analysis in this paper, a sample of 15,611 Chinese LGB people were included. Frequency and descriptive statistics were conducted to describe the LGB respondents' demographic characteristics and their experiences in health care settings. Chi-square tests were conducted to test how experiences vary across LGB people with different demographic characteristics. RESULTS: More than three quarters of the respondents said they would be willing to disclose to their medical care providers their sexual orientation if asked. However, only 5.7% of the respondents said that medical care providers ever asked them about their sexual orientation. About 8.0% of the LGB people surveyed reported having experienced negative treatment in medical care settings. Six percent (5.7%) of the Chinese LGB people said in accessing mental health care services, they were recommended, coaxed into, or provided conversion therapy for sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong need to enhance LGB cultural competence among health care providers.

The intent of the current study is to examine the application of the IMB model to clarifying the association between condom use correlates and condom use frequency among TGW in China. METHODS: Using snowball sampling, we recruited 198 self-identified TGW in Shenyang, China from April 2017 to July 2017. Participants were required to complete a questionnaire assessing their background characteristics and IMB model constructs. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to demonstrate the utility of the IMB model. RESULTS: The consistent condom use (CCU) rate was 47.0%. Results of SEM indicated that HIV-preventive motivation (comprising condom use attitude and subjective norms; beta = 0.823, P <  0.001) and behavioral skills (including condom use skills and self-efficacy; beta = 0.979, P = 0.004) were related to more frequent condom use, whereas HIV knowledge was unrelated to condom use (beta = 0.052, P = 0.540).

Social network strategy (SNS) is purposeful to use social networks to generate social influence, accelerate behaviour change and achieve desirable outcomes among individuals or communities and have been increasingly used for HIV interventions. This study aims to investigate the effects of SNS on HIV prevention among key populations. METHODS: We searched six databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect and Wiley for randomised controlled trials published between January 1999 and May 2019. Eligibility criteria included SNS conducted among key populations for HIV interventions, with a comparator group. Outcomes included changes in HIV high-risk behaviour, HIV seroconversion and other HIV outcomes. We used the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) to assess the comparative efficacy between SNS and control methods on the selected outcomes. The GRADE system was used to assess the quality of evidence for the studies. RESULTS: Of 2818 citations identified, 28 trails from 24 papers met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that SNS was associated with less unprotected intercourse (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.86) and sex with multiple partners (0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.65). Additionally, relative to the control methods, SNS significantly reduced HIV seroconversion (0.65, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.81), improved HIV testing uptake (1.11, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.15) and promoted participant retention (1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06) among key populations. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system showed that trails were of moderate quality. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that SNS can reach key populations who are currently not being reached by existing programmes and deliver HIV interventions through social networks, which decreases HIV sexual risk behaviour and HIV incidence and increases HIV testing uptake and participant retention.

Here, we investigated the role of topoisomerase IIA (Top2alpha, an enzyme that is essential in resolving entangled DNA strands during replication) in telomeric DNA damage and T cell dysfunction during viral infection. We demonstrated that T cells derived from patients with chronic viral (HBV, HCV, and HIV) infection had lower Top2alpha protein levels and enzymatic activity, along with an accumulation of the Top2alpha cleavage complex (Top2cc) in genomic DNA. In addition, T cells from virally infected subjects with lower Top2alpha levels were vulnerable to Top2alpha inhibitor-induced cell apoptosis, indicating an important role for Top2alpha in preventing DNA topological disruption and cell death. Using Top2alpha inhibitor (ICRF193 or Etoposide)-treated primary T cells as a model, we demonstrated that disrupting the DNA topology promoted DNA damage and T cell apoptosis via Top2cc accumulation that is associated with protein-DNA breaks (PDB) at genomic DNA. Disruption of the DNA topology was likely due to diminished expression of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2), which was inhibited in T cells in vitro by Top2alpha inhibitor and in vivo by chronic viral infection. These results suggest that immune-evasive viruses (HBV, HCV, and HIV) can disrupt T cell DNA topology as a mechanism of dysregulating host immunity and establishing chronic infection. Thus, restoring the DNA topologic machinery may serve as a novel strategy to protect T cells from unwanted DNA damage and to maintain immune competence.')\n",

HIV-related discrimination and psychosocial syndemics were associated with increased odds of inconsistent condom use with steady partners (AOR = 5.40 and AOR = 3.09 respectively). Findings from structural equation modeling showed that psychosocial syndemics mediated the effect of HIV-related discrimination on condom use consistency with steady partners. PLHIV in Hong Kong suffered from the syndemic effects of stigma, social isolation, and poor mental health, which rendered them vulnerable to condomless sex.

METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 160 HIV-infected patients who were initiated highly active antiretroviral therapy at Jimma University Medical Center in 2016. HRQoL was assessed using the patient-reported outcome quality of life-HIV (PROQOL-HIV) measuring scale. Linear regressions were used to identify factors associated with outcome.

METHODS: The American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS) is an annual survey of US MSM conducted in the United States among MSM aged >/=15 years since 2013. We analysed data on trends in elements of the PrEP continuum (awareness, willingness and use of PrEP) in a sample of 37,476 HIV-negative/unknown status MSM from December 2013 through November 2017. We evaluated trends in continuum steps overall and among demographic subgroups using Poisson models with Generalized Estimating Equations. For 2017 data, we used logistic regression to compare the prevalence of PrEP use among demographic groups. RESULTS: Overall, 51.4% (n = 19,244) of AMIS respondents were PrEP-eligible across study years. Between 2013 and 2017, PrEP awareness increased from 47.4% to 80.6% willingness to use PrEP increased from 43.9% to 59.5% and PrEP use in the past 12 months increased from 1.7% to 19.9%. In 2017, use of PrEP was lower for men who were younger, lived outside of urban areas, and lacked health insurance; PrEP use was not different among Black, Hispanic and white MSM. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show progress in use of PrEP among US MSM, but also reveal mismatches between PrEP use and epidemic need. We call for additional support of PrEP initiation, especially among young, non-urban and uninsured MSM.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using varied purposive methods in Toronto and Ottawa, we recruited n = 24 PWUD (who self-reported that they were living with HIV and/or HCV infection; currently or had previously used drugs or alcohol in ways that were harmful; had a hospital admission in the past five years) and n = 26 health care providers (who were: currently working in an academic hospital as a physician, nurse, social worker or other allied health professional; and 2) providing care to this patient group). All n = 50 participants completed a short, socio-demographic questionnaire and an audio-recorded semi-structured interview about receiving or providing acute care in a hospital between 04/2014 and 05/2015. Patient participants received $25 CAD and return transit fare; provider participants received a $50 CAD gift card for a bookseller. All participants provided informed consent. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim, corrected, and uploaded to NVivo 10. Using the seven-step framework method, transcripts were coded line-by-line and managed using NVvivo. An analytic framework was created by grouping and mapping the codes. Preliminary analyses were presented to advisory group members for comment and used to refine the interpretation. Questionnaire data were managed using SPSS version 22.0 and descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants. Many but not all patient participants spoke about using psycho-active substances not prescribed to them during a hospital admission. Attempts to avoid negative experiences (e.g., withdrawal, boredom, sadness, loneliness and/or untreated pain) were cited as reasons for illicit drug use. Most tried to conceal their illicit drug use from health care providers. Patients described how their self-reported level of pain was not always believed, tolerance to opioids was ignored, and requests for higher doses of pain medications denied. Some health care providers were unaware of on-site illicit drug use; others acknowledged it occurred. Few could identify a hospital policy specific to illicit drug use and most used their personal beliefs to guide their responses to it (e.g., ignore it, increase surveillance of patients, reprimands, loss of privileges/medications, threats of immediate discharge should it continue, and substitution dosing of medication). CONCLUSIONS: Providers highlighted gaps in institutional guidance for how they ought to appropriately respond to in-hospital substance use.

Pregnant women were eligible if they lived in study clusters allocated to standard-of-care (SOC; 52 clusters); IYCF (20 g small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement/day from 6 to 18 months, complementary feeding counselling; 53 clusters); WASH (pit latrine, 2 hand-washing stations, liquid soap, chlorine, play space, hygiene counselling; 53 clusters) or IYCF +WASH (53 clusters). Participants and fieldworkers were not blinded. ECD was assessed at 24 months using the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT; assessing motor, cognitive, language and social skills); MacArthur Bates Communication Development Inventory (assessing vocabulary and grammar); A-not-B test (assessing object permanence) and a self-control task. Intention-to-treat analyses were stratified by maternal HIV status. RESULTS: Compared with SOC, children randomised to combined IYCF +WASH had higher total MDAT scores (mean difference +4.6; 95% CI 1.9 to 7.2) and MacArthur Bates vocabulary scores (+8.5 words; 95% CI 3.7 to 13.3), but there was no evidence of effects from IYCF or WASH alone.

Therefore, identifying interventions that can reverse latency and also enhance immune mediated clearance is of high interest. Interferons (IFNs) have multiple immune enhancing effects and can inhibit HIV replication in activated CD4+ T cells. However, the effects of IFNs on the establishment and reversal of HIV latency is not understood.

However, once latency was established, IFNalpha but no other IFNs were able to efficiently reverse latency in both an in vitro model of latency and CD4+ T cells collected from PLWH on suppressive ART.

The role of race/ethnicity in the composition of the vaginal microbiome and what is deemed normal/healthy microbiome is conflicting. Thus, the purpose of this review is to synthesize research that investigated the vaginal microbiome in Black women in the United States by using advanced 16S analysis. Methods: Searches of Pubmed, Google Scholar, and relevant journals for publications between January 2008 and July 2018 were conducted. Eligibility criteria were that the study: (1) used a molecular technique for sequencing of the vaginal microbiome, (2) reported the microbiome by race/ethnicity that included Black women, and (3) was conducted in the United States. Results: Our review selected 18 manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria for full review. Three themes emerged: the vaginal microbiome in healthy women versus women with bacterial vaginosis (BV); vaginal microbiome considerations in HIV; and vaginal microbiome considerations in preterm labor/birth. Overall, our review found that a majority of Black women (including HIV-positive women) have a Lactobacillus dominant group. Specifically, Lactobacillus iners was the most frequently reported Lactobacillus species. Non-Lactobacillus dominant groups were also reported to be found in healthy asymptomatic Black women. The vaginal microbiome's influence on preterm labor and/or birth among Black women was inconclusive and warrants further investigation. Conclusions: The role that the microbiome plays in health and disease among Black women warrants further research to better elucidate the definition of a healthy versus pathogenic microbiome. The wide variability in methods for BV diagnostics and defining preterm labor/birth are significant limitations that should be considered when conducting comparative studies.\")\n",

We aimed to analyze the demographics and outcomes of the HIV-associated NHLs. METHODS: Between 2005 and 2014, PLWHIV with NHLs were retrospectively enrolled at a tertiary referral center. Characteristics and survival were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-two HIV-associated NHLs were identified, with a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 0.1-139.7), including eight diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), eight primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs), and six Burkitt's lymphomas (BLs). Nine patients (40.9%) were diagnosed with NHLs and HIV infection concurrently. The prognosis of DLBCL patients tended to be better prognosis than that of BL and PCNSL patients (median overall survival: not reached vs. 3.5 months, p = 0.056). Very early mortality (death within 14 days after NHL diagnosis) was noted in five patients (22.7%), and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a predictive factor for very early mortality among PLWHIV (hazard ratio:11.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-114.4, p = 0.04).

Routine provincial surveillance in Ontario assesses and reports on the epidemiology of single infectious diseases separately. Therefore, we aimed to develop a method that allows disease overlaps to be examined routinely as a path to better understanding and addressing syndemics in Ontario. INTERVENTION: We extracted data for individuals with a record of chlamydia, gonorrhea, infectious syphilis, hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS, invasive group A streptococcal disease (iGAS), or tuberculosis in Ontario's reportable disease database from 1990 to 2018. We transformed the data into a person-based integrated surveillance dataset retaining individuals (clients) with at least one record between 2006 and 2018. OUTCOMES: The resulting dataset had 659,136 unique disease records among 470,673 unique clients. Of those clients, 23.1% had multiple disease records with 50 being the most for one client. We described the frequency of disease overlaps; for example, 34.7% of clients with a syphilis record had a gonorrhea record. We quantified known overlaps, finding 1274 clients had gonorrhea, infectious syphilis, and HIV/AIDS records, and potentially emerging overlaps, finding 59 clients had HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and iGAS records. IMPLICATIONS: Our novel person-based integrated surveillance dataset represents a platform for ongoing in-depth assessment of disease overlaps such as the relative timing of disease records. It enables a more client-focused approach, is a step towards improved characterization of syndemics in Ontario, and could inform other jurisdictions interested in adopting similar approaches.\")\n",

Here, a series of HIV-specific antibody subclass and hinge variants were constructed and tested to define those properties associated with differential effector function. In the context of the broadly neutralizing CD4 binding site-specific antibody VRC01 and the variable loop (V3) binding antibody 447-52D, hinge truncation and extension had a considerable impact on the magnitude of phagocytic activity of both IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. The improvement in phagocytic potency of antibodies with extended hinges could not be attributed to changes in either intrinsic antigen or antibody receptor affinity. This effect was specific to phagocytosis and was generalizable to different phagocytes, at different effector cell to target ratios, for target particles of different size and composition, and occurred across a range of antibody concentrations. Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and neutralization were generally independent of hinge length, and complement deposition displayed variable local optima. In vivo stability testing showed that IgG molecules with altered hinges can exhibit similar biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles as IgG1. Overall, these results suggest that when high phagocytic activity is desirable, therapeutic antibodies may benefit from being formatted as human IgG3 or engineered IgG1 forms with elongated hinges.')\n",

Using similar definitions, this study aimed to examine predictors of lupus retention in care, to develop an SLE Care Continuum and inform interventions to reduce disparities. We hypothesized that Black patients and those residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods would have lower retention in care. METHODS: Abstractors manually validated 545 potential adult cases with SLE codes in 2013-2014 using 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or 2012 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria. We identified 397 SLE patients who met ACR or SLICC criteria for definite lupus, had at least one baseline rheumatology visit, and were alive through 2015. Retention in care was defined as having two ambulatory rheumatology visits or SLE labs (e.g., complement tests) during the outcome year 2015, analogous to HIV retention definitions. Explanatory variables included age, sex, race, ethnicity, smoking status, neighborhood area deprivation index (ADI), number of SLE criteria, and nephritis. We used multivariable logistic regression to test our hypothesis and model predictors of SLE retention in care. RESULTS: Among 397 SLE patients, 91% were female, 56% White, 39% Black, and 5% Hispanic. Notably, 51% of Black versus 5% of White SLE patients resided in the most disadvantaged ADI neighborhood quartile. Overall, 60% met visit-defined retention and 27% met complement lab-defined retention in 2015. Retention was 59% lower for patients in the most disadvantaged neighborhood quartile (adjusted OR 0.41, CI 0.18, 0.93). No statistical difference was seen based on age, sex, race, or ethnicity. More SLE criteria and non-smoking predicted greater retention. CONCLUSIONS: Disadvantaged neighborhood residence was the strongest factor predicting poor SLE retention in care.

METHODS: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial (IPCAVD010/HPX1002) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA. We included healthy, HIV-uninfected participants (aged 18-50 years) who were considered at low risk for HIV infection and had not received any vaccines in the 14 days before study commencement. We randomly assigned participants via a computer-generated randomisation schedule and interactive web response system to one of three study groups (1:1:1) testing different regimens of trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV (5 x 10(10) viral particles per 0.5 mL) combined with 250 mug adjuvanted clade C gp140 protein.

Group 3 received Ad26.Mos.HIV alone at week 0 and Ad26.Mos.HIV plus adjuvanted gp140 at weeks 8 and 24. Participants in the control group received 0.5 mL of 0.9% saline. All study interventions were administered intramuscularly. The primary endpoints were Env-specific binding antibody responses at weeks 28, 52, and 72 and safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimens for 28 days after the injection. All participants who received at least one vaccine dose or placebo were included in the safety analysis; immunogenicity was analysed using the per-protocol population. The IPCAVD010/HPX1002 trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02685020. We also did a parallel preclinical study in rhesus monkeys to test the protective efficacy of the shortened group 3 regimen. FINDINGS: Between March 7, 2016, and Aug 19, 2016, we randomly assigned 36 participants to receive at least one dose of study vaccine or placebo, ten to each vaccine group and two to the corresponding placebo group. 30 (83%) participants completed the full study, and six (17%) discontinued it prematurely because of loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, investigator decision, and an unrelated death from a motor vehicle accident. The two shortened regimens elicited comparable antibody titres against autologous clade C Env at peak immunity to the longer, 12-month regimen: geometric mean titre (GMT) 41 007 (95% CI 17 959-93 636) for group 2 and 49 243 (29 346-82 630) for group 3 at week 28 compared with 44 590 (19 345-102 781) for group 1 at week 52). Antibody responses remained increased (GMT >5000) in groups 2 and 3 at week 52 but were highest in group 1 at week 72. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, Env-specific IgG3, tier 1A neutralising activity, and broad cellular immune responses were detected in all groups. All vaccine regimens were well tolerated. Mild-to-moderate pain or tenderness at the injection site was the most commonly reported solicited local adverse event, reported by 28 vaccine recipients (93%) and two placebo recipients (33%). Grade 3 solicited systemic adverse events were reported by eight (27%) vaccine recipients and no placebo recipients; the most commonly reported grade 3 systemic symptoms were fatigue, myalgia, and chills. The shortened group 3 regimen induced comparable peak immune responses in 30 rhesus monkeys as in humans and resulted in an 83% (95% CI 38.7-95, p=0.004 log-rank test) reduction in per-exposure acquisition risk after six intrarectal challenges with SHIV-SF162P3 at week 54, more than 6 months after final vaccination. INTERPRETATION: Short, 6-month regimens of a mosaic HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine elicited robust HIV-specific immune responses that were similar to responses elicited by a longer, 12-month schedule. Preclinical data showed partial protective efficacy of one of the short vaccine regimens in rhesus monkeys. Further clinical studies are required to test the suitability of the shortened vaccine regimens in humans.

Therefore, broad-spectrum anti-EV drugs are urgently needed to treat EV infection. Here, we demonstrate that FNC (2'-deoxy-2'-beta-fluoro-4'-azidocytidine), a small nucleoside analog inhibitor that has been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of HIV and entered into a clinical phase II trial in China, potently inhibits the viral replication of a multitude of EVs, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), CA6, EVD68, and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), at the nanomolar level. The antiviral mechanism of FNC involves mainly positive- and negative-strand RNA synthesis inhibition by targeting and competitively inhibiting the activity of EV71 viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D(pol)), as demonstrated through quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR), in vitro 3D(pol) activity, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. We further demonstrated that FNC treatment every 2 days with 1 mg/kg of body weight in EV71 and CA16 infection neonatal mouse models successfully protected mice from lethal challenge with EV71 and CA16 viruses and reduced the viral load in various tissues. These findings provide important information for the clinical development of FNC as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of human EV pathogens.IMPORTANCE Human enterovirus (EV) pathogens cause various contagious diseases such as hand, foot, and mouth disease, encephalitis, myocarditis, acute flaccid myelitis, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, which have become serious health threats. However, except for the EV71 vaccine on the market, there are no effective strategies to prevent and treat other EV pathogen infections. Therefore, broad-spectrum anti-EV drugs are urgently needed. In this study, we demonstrated that FNC, a small nucleoside analog inhibitor that has been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of HIV and entered into a clinical phase II trial in China, potently inhibits the viral replication of a multitude of EVs at the nanomolar level. Further investigation revealed that FNC inhibits positive- and negative-strand RNA synthesis of EVs by interacting and interfering with the activity of EV71 viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D(pol)). Our findings demonstrate for the first time that FNC is an effective broad-spectrum inhibitor for human EV pathogens.\")\n",

We assayed >60 modulators of RNA alternative splicing (AS) to identify new inhibitors of HIV-1 RNA processing-a segment of the viral lifecycle not targeted by current drugs-and discovered compound N-[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-amine (5342191) as a potent inhibitor of both wild-type (Ba-L, NL4-3, LAI, IIIB, and N54) and drug-resistant strains of HIV-1 (IC50: ~700 nM) with no significant effect on cell viability at doses tested. 5342191 blocks expression of four essential HIV-1 structural and regulatory proteins (Gag, Env, Tat, and Rev) without affecting total protein synthesis of the cell. This response is associated with altered unspliced (US) and singly-spliced (SS) HIV-1 RNA accumulation (~60% reduction) and transport to the cytoplasm (loss of Rev) whereas parallel analysis of cellular RNAs revealed less than a 0.7% of host alternative splicing (AS) events (0.25-0.67% by >/= 10-20%), gene expression (0.01-0.46% by >/= 2-5 fold), and protein abundance (0.02-0.34% by >/= 1.5-2 fold) being affected. Decreased expression of Tat, but not Gag/Env, upon 5342191 treatment was reversed by a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that this compound alters the synthesis/degradation of this key viral factor. Consistent with an affect on HIV-1 RNA processing, 5342191 treatment of cells altered the abundance and phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) 1, 3, and 4. Despite the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways by 5342191 (Ras, MEK1/2-ERK1/2, and JNK1/2/3), inhibition of HIV-1 gene expression by this compound could be reversed by pre-treatment with either a G-protein alpha-subunit inhibitor or two different MEK1/2 inhibitors.

Investigating the association between liver fibrosis and type of HF, specifically HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF; HFrEF) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), may provide mechanistic insight into this association. We sought to determine the association between liver fibrosis score (FIB-4) and type of HF, and to assess whether HIV or hepatitis C status modified this association. METHODS: We included patients alive on or after 4/1/2003 from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. We followed patients without prevalent cardiovascular disease until their first HF event, death, last clinic visit, or 9/30/2015. We defined liver fibrosis as: likely advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 > 3.25), indeterminate (FIB-4 range 1.45-3.25), unlikely advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 < 1.45). Primary outcomes were HFrEF and HFpEF (defined using ICD-9 diagnoses for HF, and EF extracted from electronic medical records using natural language processing). Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for potential confounders and used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). RESULTS: Among 108,708 predominantly male (96%) participants mean age was 49 years. Likely advanced fibrosis was present in 4% at baseline and was associated with an increased risk of HFpEF [HR (95% confidence interval)] [1.70 (1.3-2.3)]; and non-significantly with HFrEF [1.20 (0.9-1.7)]. These associations were not modified by HIV or hepatitis C status. CONCLUSION: Likely advanced fibrosis was independently associated with incident HFpEF but not HFrEF.

Since 2011, there have been major changes in eligibility criteria and treatment regimens with price reductions in ART drugs, programmatic changes resulting in clinical task-shifting and decentralization of ART delivery to peripheral health centres making existing evidence on ART care costs in Zambia out-of-date. As decision makers consider further changes in ART service delivery, it is important to understand the current drivers of costs for ART care. This study provides updates on costs of ART services for HIV-positive patients in Zambia. METHODS: We evaluated costs, assessed from the health systems perspective and expressed in 2016 USD, based on an activity-based costing framework using both top-down and bottom-up methods with an assessment of process and capacity. We collected primary site-level costs and resource utilization data from government documents, patient chart reviews and time-and-motion studies conducted in 10 purposively selected ART clinics. RESULTS: The cost of providing ART varied considerably among the ten clinics. The average per-patient annual cost of ART service was $116.69 (range: $59.38 to $145.62) using a bottom-up method and $130.32 (range: $94.02 to $162.64) using a top-down method. ART drug costs were the main cost driver (67% to 7% of all costs) and are highly sensitive to the types of patient included in the analysis (long-term vs. all ART patients, including those recently initiated) and the data sources used (facility vs. patient level). Missing capacity costs made up 57% of the total difference between the top-down and bottom-up estimates. Variability in cost across the ten clinics was associated with operational characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world costs of current routine ART services in Zambia are considerably lower than previously reported estimates and sensitive to operational factors and methods used. We recommend collection and monitoring of resource use and capacity data to periodically update cost estimates.')\n",

OBJECTIVES: To compare deep sequencing performance to standard Sanger genotyping with clinical samples, in an effort to delineate the correlation between the results from the two methods and to find the optimal deep sequencing threshold for clinical utilisation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using stored plasma collected from August 2014 to March 2018 for HIV genotyping with the commercial Sanger genotyping kit. Samples with available Sanger genotyping reports were further deep sequenced. Drug resistance was interpreted according to the Stanford HIV drug resistance database algorithm. RESULTS: At 15-25% minority detection thresholds, 9-15% cases had underestimated DRMs by Sanger sequencing. The concordance between the Sanger and deep sequencing reports was 68-82% in protease-reverse transcriptase region and 88-97% in integrase region at 5-25% thresholds. The undetected drug resistant minority variants by Sanger sequencing contributed to the lower negative predictive value of Sanger genotyping in cases harbouring DRMs. CONCLUSIONS: Use of deep sequencing improved detection of antiretroviral resistance mutations especially in cases with virological failure or previous treatment interruption.

This study demonstrates how time and population dynamics impact UNAIDS 90-90-90 metrics in comparison with a longitudinal analogue. DESIGN: A simplified simulation representing a hypothetical population was used to estimate and compare inference from UNAIDS 90-90-90 metrics and longitudinal metrics based on Kaplan-Meier-estimated 2-year probability of transition between stages. METHODS: We simulated a large cohort over 15 years. Everyone started out at risk for HIV, and then transitioned through the HIV care continuum based on fixed daily probabilities of acquiring HIV, learning status, entering care, initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), and becoming virally suppressed, or dying. We varied the probability of ART initiation over three five-year periods (low, high, and low). We repeated the simulation with an increased probability of death. RESULTS: The cross-sectional probability of being on ART among persons who were diagnosed responded relatively slowly to changes in the rate of ART initiation. Increases in ART initiation rates caused apparent declines in the cross-sectional probability of being virally suppressed among persons who had initiated ART, despite no changes in the rate of viral suppression. In some cases, higher mortality resulted in the cross-sectional metrics implying improved healthcare system performance. The longitudinal continuum was robust to these issues. CONCLUSION: The UNAIDS 90-90-90 care continuum may lead to incorrect inference when used to evaluate health systems performance. We recommend that evaluation of HIV care delivery include longitudinal care continuum metrics wherever possible.\")\n",

Demographic and behavioral attributes related to HIV testing, sexual health, and healthcare utilization were evaluated. Poisson regression analysis was used to identify demographics and behaviors associated with having had a previous HIV test. Significance was defined as a p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Among 105 women evaluated, 77% knew someone with HIV and 73% of women reported that they would be very or extremely likely to take an HIV test if offered. Only 68% reported a previous HIV test, including 47% who were tested over 2 years prior. Barriers to HIV testing included low risk perception (23%), distance or requisite travel (13%), and discomfort being tested (11%). Women who had never been tested for HIV were more likely than those who had been tested to be older (p = 0.03), to have a lower level of education (p = 0.04), and to have never been tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STI; p <  0.01).

Although viral latency is a critical factor in this persistence, recent evidence also suggests a role for intrinsic resistance of reservoir-harboring cells to CTL killing. This resistance may have contributed to negative outcomes of clinical trials, where pharmacologic latency reversal has thus far failed to drive reductions in HIV reservoirs. Through transcriptional profiling, we herein identified overexpression of the prosurvival factor B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) as a distinguishing feature of CD4+ T cells that survived CTL killing. We show that the inducible HIV reservoir was disproportionately present in BCL-2hi subsets in ex vivo CD4+ T cells. Treatment with the BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199 was not sufficient to drive reductions in ex vivo viral reservoirs when tested either alone or with a latency-reversing agent (LRA). However, the triple combination of strong LRAs, HIV-specific T cells, and a BCL-2 antagonist uniquely enabled the depletion of ex vivo viral reservoirs. Our results provide rationale for novel therapeutic approaches targeting HIV cure and, more generally, suggest consideration of BCL-2 antagonism as a means of enhancing CTL immunotherapy in other settings, such as cancer.')\n",

The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) was used to report this study. RESULTS: The findings show that the structure of the experience of people living with HIV and adhering to ART is composed of six essential common constituents: (a) ART adherence has become a prerequisite for a normal life; (b) Endless adjustments responding to a sensitive body; (c) Dosing Time becomes the framework of the day; (d) Dosing time needing to coincide with the availability of confidential dosing space; (e) Classification of Relationships-those who know of my taking antiretroviral drugs and those who do not; and (f) Recognition of the multiple relationships affecting ART. CONCLUSION: Adhering to ART is experienced by people infected with HIV not only as a process they want to hide, but also a critical lifeline that stabilizes their lives. That is, their day-to-day living is split into a double life reflecting their coexisting need for concealment and exposure. IMPACT: Although much existing literature focuses on the adherence to medication, this study reveals the meaning of ART in the context of viewing the patient as an independent subject.

We determined the impact of Depo-Provera on cervical immune cells and mediators in healthy women. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, vaginal, endocervical, and rectal swabs were collected at baseline (visit 1), 1 month (visit 2), and 3 months (visit 3) after Depo-Provera injection. Cervical cells were collected by cytobrush and immune markers on cervical CD4 T cells were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry at three different visits. The levels of immune mediators in cytobrush supernatants as well as vaginal, cervical, and rectal secretions from swabs were analyzed by multiplex assays and ELISA. RESULTS: Compared with baseline levels, we found a significant increase in the frequency of cervical CCR5CD4 T cells and a significant decrease in the frequency of cervical central memory CD4 T cells. Depo-Provera treatment had little effect on expression of immune mediators in rectal mucosa but significantly suppressed numerous immune mediators at cervicovaginal mucosa. Levels of MCP-1, G-CSF, IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF, and IP-10 were significantly decreased in both vaginal and cervical secretions after Depo-Provera injection. In cervical samples collected by cytobrush, we found reduced levels of 22 of 25 immune mediators after Depo-Provera injection. Changes in immune mediators differed between vaginal and cervical mucosa, demonstrating compartment-specific responses. CONCLUSION: Depo-Provera altered immune profiles of cervical CD4 T cells and suppressed host immune response at cervicovaginal mucosa, suggesting its likely effect on transmission of sexually transmitted infections including HIV.')\n",

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a unique human RNA virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in infected individuals. During the replication cycle, HIV-1 undergoes reverse transcription of its RNA genome and integrates the resulting DNA into the human genome. Subsequently, transcription of the integrated provirus results in production of new virions and spreading infection of the virus. Throughout the viral replication cycle, numerous nucleic acid derived PAMPs can be recognized by a diverse set of innate immune sensors in infected cells. However, HIV-1 has evolved efficient strategies to evade or counteract this immune surveillance and the downstream responses. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of the concerted actions of the innate immune system, as well as the corresponding viral evasion mechanisms during infection, is critical to understanding HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis, and may provide important guidance for the design of appropriate adjuvant and vaccine strategies. Here, we summarize current knowledge of the molecular basis for sensing HIV-1 in human cells, including CD4(+) T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying mechanisms by which innate sensing is regulated, and describe the strategies developed by HIV-1 to evade sensing and immune responses.\")\n",

METHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective survey of 1,171 mother-infant pairs with HIV-exposed infants aged 4-12 weeks who were recruited from 151 immunization clinics from February to August 2013. HIV-exposed infants were followed until diagnosed with HIV, death, or age 18 months. Findings were weighted and adjusted for complex survey design and nonresponse. RESULTS: The 18-month cumulative MTCT risk was highest among adolescent aged </=19 years (12%) followed by young women aged 20-24 years (7.5%) and adult women aged >/=25 years (6.9%).

We studied linkages to HIV confirmatory test and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation among Thai MSM and TGW who chose online and/or offline platforms for HIV testing and factors associated with unsuccessful linkages. METHODS: MSM and TGW were enrolled from Bangkok Metropolitan Region and Pattaya during December 2015 to June 2017 and followed for 12 months. Participants could choose between: 1) offline HIV counselling and testing (Offline group), 2) online pre-test counselling and offline HIV testing (Mixed group) and 3) online counselling and online, supervised, HIV self-testing (Online group). Sociodemographic data, risk behaviour and social network use characteristics were collected by self-administered questionnaires. Linkages to HIV confirmatory testing and/or ART initiation were collected from participants who tested reactive/positive at baseline and during study follow-up. Modified Poisson regression models identified covariates for poor retention and unsuccessful ART initiation. RESULTS: Of 465 MSM and 99 TGW, 200 self-selected the Offline group, 156 the Mixed group and 208 the Online group. The Online group demonstrated highest HIV prevalence (15.0% vs. 13.0% vs. 3.4%) and high HIV incidence (5.1 vs. 8.3 vs. 3.2 per 100 person-years), compared to the Offline and Mixed groups. Among 60 baseline HIV positive and 18 seroconversion participants, successful ART initiation in the Online group (52.8%) was lower than the Offline (84.8%) and Mixed groups (77.8%). Factors associated with unsuccessful ART initiation included choosing to be in the Online group (aRR 3.94, 95% CI 1.07 to 14.52), <17 years old at first sex (aRR 3.02, 95% CI 1.15 to 7.92), amphetamine-type stimulants use in the past six months (aRR 3.6, 95% CI 1.22 to 10.64) and no/single sex partner (aRR 3.84, 95%CI 1.36 to 10.83) in the past six months. CONCLUSIONS: Online, supervised, HIV self-testing allowed more MSM and TGW to know their HIV status.

To better understand the potential benefits of geo-targeted control, we assessed the extent to which HIV hotspots along Lake Victoria sustain transmission in neighbouring populations in south-central Uganda. METHODS: We did a population-based survey in Rakai, Uganda, using data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study. The study surveyed all individuals aged 15-49 years in four high-prevalence Lake Victoria fishing communities and 36 neighbouring inland communities. Viral RNA was deep sequenced from participants infected with HIV who were antiretroviral therapy-naive during the observation period. Phylogenetic analysis was used to infer partial HIV transmission networks, including direction of transmission. Reconstructed networks were interpreted through data for current residence and migration history. HIV transmission flows within and between high-prevalence and low-prevalence areas were quantified adjusting for incomplete sampling of the population. FINDINGS: Between Aug 10, 2011, and Jan 30, 2015, data were collected for the Rakai Community Cohort Study. 25 882 individuals participated, including an estimated 75.7% of the lakeside population and 16.2% of the inland population in the Rakai region of Uganda. 5142 participants were HIV-positive (2703 [13.7%] in inland and 2439 [40.1%] in fishing communities). 3878 (75.4%) people who were HIV-positive did not report antiretroviral therapy use, of whom 2652 (68.4%) had virus deep-sequenced at sufficient quality for phylogenetic analysis. 446 transmission networks were reconstructed, including 293 linked pairs with inferred direction of transmission. Adjusting for incomplete sampling, an estimated 5.7% (95% credibility interval 4.4-7.3) of transmissions occurred within lakeside areas, 89.2% (86.0-91.8) within inland areas, 1.3% (0.6-2.6) from lakeside to inland areas, and 3.7% (2.3-5.8) from inland to lakeside areas. INTERPRETATION: Cross-community HIV transmissions between Lake Victoria hotspots and surrounding inland populations are infrequent and when they occur, virus more commonly flows into rather than out of hotspots. This result suggests that targeted interventions to these hotspots will not alone control the epidemic in inland populations, where most transmissions occur. Thus, geographical targeting of high prevalence areas might not be effective for broader epidemic control depending on underlying epidemic dynamics.

A conceptual framework for understanding this mental health disparity is minority stress theory, which posits that experiences of external prejudice events (i.e., distal stressors) and internal stress processes such as internalized homophobia and concealment (i.e., proximal stressors) contribute to sexual minorities' elevated risk of psychological distress. To deepen the understanding of mental health among Chinese MSM and explore the potential utility of minority stress theory in this population, this paper synthesizes research evidence regarding prevalent mental health issues as well as how minority stress may be linked to psychological health in Chinese MSM. RECENT FINDINGS: Results indicate that Chinese MSM experience a high prevalence of several mental health issues including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors, and alcohol dependence. This review further reveals minority stress to be an important determinant of psychological distress among Chinese MSM, though evidence is mixed regarding the relationship between proximal minority stress and psychological health. Nonetheless, there is a lack of mental health services and interventions focusing on MSM in China. Culturally relevant, competent, and LGBT-affirmative mental health interventions are needed for Chinese MSM. To guide future intervention research, we provide considerations for reducing minority stress and promoting psychological health among Chinese MSM.\")\n",

We examined how HIV status influences knowledge, beliefs, and perception of risk for ASCVD and ASCVD prevention behaviors. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a mixed-methods study of 191 PLHIV and demographically similar HIV-uninfected adults. Participants completed self-reported surveys on CVD risk perceptions, adherence to CVD medication (aspirin, antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering medication) and 3 dietary intake interviews. All wore an accelerometer to measure physical activity. A subset of PLHIV (n = 38) also completed qualitative focus groups to further examine the influence of HIV on knowledge, perception of risk for ASCVD, and behavior. PARTICIPANTS: They were approximately 54 (+/-10) years, mostly men (n = 111; 58%), and African American (n = 151, 83%) with an average 10-year risk of an ASCVD event of 10.4 (+/-8.2)%. PLHIV were less likely to engage in physical activity (44% vs 65%, P < 0.05), and HIV status was associated with 43 fewer minutes of physical activity per week (P = 0.004). Adherence to ASCVD medications was better among PLHIV (P < 0.001). Diet composition was similar between groups (P > 0.05). HIV status did not influence ASCVD risk perceptions (P > 0.05) and modestly influenced physical activity and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Although perceptions of ASCVD risk modestly influence some behaviors, additional barriers and insufficient cues to action result in suboptimal physical activity, dietary intake, and smoking rates. However, PLHIV have high adherence to ASCVD medications, which can be harnessed to reduce their high burden of ASCVD.')\n",

Neuropsychiatric adverse events (NP-AEs) have been reported with DTG but neuropsychiatric symptoms have not been systemically quantified using structured scales. This study examined mood and cognitive parameters before and after a planned transition from non-DTG to DTG-based ART within a longitudinal study of acute HIV infection (AHI). METHODS: RV254 AHI cohort participants on >/= 24 weeks of ART initiated at AHI underwent sequential assessments before and after the switch including: (1) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a 9-item survey (scores 0-27) that evaluates somatic and affective/cognitive symptoms of depression; (2) a 2-Questions screening that has been validated locally for depression; (3) Distress Thermometer (scores 0-10); and 4) administration of a 4-test neurocognitive battery sensitive to HIV. RESULTS: 254 individuals (95% male, median age 30) switched to a DTG-based regimen after a median 144 weeks of ART. Serial assessments were completed at a median of 19 weeks before and 37 weeks after DTG. There was a modest but statistically significant increase in PHQ-9 scores after DTG (pre-switch: 5 [IQR 1-7] vs. Post-switch: 5 [IQR 2-8], p = 0.009). The percentage of participants with at least moderate depression (PHQ-9 >/= 10) increased from 10 to 16% (p = 0.006), but the frequency of moderate-severe depression (PHQ-9 >/= 15) remained unchanged (3%). No volunteer reported NP-AEs within the study period. Somatic symptoms of depression increased more than cognitive/affective symptoms. Plasma viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50; p = 0.005) and PHQ-9 >/= 10 (p < 0.001) before switch were linked to lower PHQ-9 scores after DTG in multivariable analysis. Performance on all neuropsychological tests, except grooved pegboard test, improved modestly after DTG (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: After a median duration of 37 weeks of DTG use, there was a modest increase in the higher quartile of PHQ-9. This increase was associated with a rise in moderate depression symptoms but not the more severe forms of depression on PHQ-9. No clinically relevant NP-AEs were reported. Pre-existing depression was not associated with subsequent worsening of symptoms after DTG. Cognitive test performance improved post-DTG but could be due to practice effect.')\n",

A Randomized, Controlled Trial.', \"['Hauzeur JP', 'Lechanteur C', 'Baudoux E', 'De Maertelaer V', 'Pather S', 'Katz R', 'Malaise M', 'Ino J', 'Beguin Y']\", '', 'BACKGROUND: In patients with nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), implantation of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) could delay the progression of osteonecrosis and improve symptoms in pre-fracture ONFH. However, the BMAC content, especially in osteoblastic stem cells, could have an important individual variability. An autologous osteoblastic cell product could improve the effect of such cell-based therapy. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does autologous osteoblastic cell therapy decrease the likelihood of progression to subchondral fracture with or without early collapse corresponding to Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification Stage III or higher, and provide a clinically important pain improvement compared with BMAC treatment alone? (2) Were patients treated with osteoblastic cell therapy less likely to undergo subsequent THA? (3) What proportion of patients in the treatment and control groups experienced adverse events after surgery? METHODS: Between 2004 and 2011, we treated 279 patients for Stage I to II hip osteonecrosis (ON) with surgery. During that time, our general indications for surgery in this setting included non-fracture ON lesions. To be eligible for this randomized, single-blind trial, patients needed to have an ONFH Stage I or II; we excluded those with traumatic ONFH, hemoglobinopathies and positive serology for hepatitis B, C or HIV. Of those treated surgically for this diagnosis during the study period, 24% (67) agreed to participate in this randomized trial. Hips with pre-fracture ONFH were randomly treated with a core decompression procedure associated with either implantation of a BMAC (BMAC group; n = 26) or osteoblastic cell (osteoblastic cell group; n = 30). The groups were not different in terms of clinical and imaging characteristics. The primary study outcome was treatment response, defined as the absence of progression to subchondral fracture stage (ARCO stage III or higher) plus a clinically important pain improvement defined as 1 cm on a 10-cm VAS. The secondary endpoint of interest was the frequency in each group of subsequent THA and the frequency of adverse events. The follow-up duration was 36 months. We used an as-treated analysis (rather than intention-to-treat) for our efficacy endpoint, and an intention-to-treat analysis for adverse events. Overall, 26 of 26 patients in the BMAC group and 27 of 30 in the osteoblastic cell group completed the trial. RESULTS: At 36 months, no clinically important differences were found in any study endpoint. There was no difference in the proportion of patients who had progressed to fracture (ARCO stage III or higher; 46% of the BMAC hips [12 of 26] versus 22% in the hips with osteoblastic cells [six of 27], hazard ratio, 0.47 [95% CI 0.17 to 1.31]; p = 0.15). There was no clinically important difference in VAS pain scores. No differences were found for either the WOMAC or the Lequesne indexes. With the numbers available, there was no difference in the proportion of patients in the groups who underwent THA at 36 months 15% (four of 27) with osteoblastic cells versus 35% (nine of 26) with BMAC; p = 0.09 With the numbers available, we found no differences between the treatment and control groups in terms of the frequencies of major adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: We found no benefit to osteoblastic cells over BMAC in patients with pre-collapse ONFH; side effects were uncommon and generally mild in both groups. This study could be used as pilot data to help determine sample sizes for larger (presumably multicenter) randomized controlled trials. However, this novel treatment cannot be recommended in routine practice until future, larger studies demonstrate efficacy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.')\n",

Quantifying excess mortality associated with cancer treatment-related immunosuppression may help inform cancer treatment guidelines for persons with HIV. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between cancer treatment and CD4 count and HIV RNA level in persons with HIV and between posttreatment CD4 count and HIV RNA trajectories and all-cause mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational cohort study included 196 adults with HIV who had an incident first cancer and available cancer treatment data while in the care of The Johns Hopkins HIV Clinic from January 1, 1997, through March 1, 2016. The study hypothesized that chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in people with HIV would increase HIV RNA levels owing to treatment tolerability issues and would be associated with a larger initial decline in CD4 count and slower CD4 recovery compared with surgery or other treatment. An additional hypothesis was that these CD4 count declines would be associated with higher mortality independent of baseline CD4 count, antiretroviral therapy use, and risk due to the underlying cancer. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, through April 1, 2018. EXPOSURES: Initial cancer treatment category (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy vs surgery or other treatment). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Post-cancer treatment longitudinal CD4 count, longitudinal HIV RNA level, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among the 196 participants (135 [68.9%] male; median age, 50 [interquartile range, 43-55] years), chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy decreased initial CD4 count by 203 cells/muL (95% CI, 92-306 cells/muL) among those with a baseline CD4 count of greater than 500 cells/muL. The decline for those with a baseline CD4 count of no greater than 350 cells/muL was 45 cells/muL (interaction estimate, 158 cells/muL; 95% CI, 31-276 cells/muL). Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy had no detrimental association with HIV RNA levels. After initial cancer treatment, every 100 cells/muL decrease in CD4 count resulted in a 27% increase in mortality (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.08-1.53), adjusting for HIV RNA level. No significant increase in mortality was associated with a unit increase in log10 HIV RNA after adjusting for CD4 count (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.94-1.65). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy was associated with significantly reduced initial CD4 count in adults with HIV compared with surgery or other treatment. Lower CD4 count after cancer treatment was associated with an increased hazard of mortality. Further research is necessary on the immunosuppressive effects of cancer treatment in adults with HIV and whether health care professionals must consider the balance of cancer treatment efficacy against the potential cost of further immunosuppression. Monitoring of immune status may also be helpful given the decrease in CD4 count after treatment and the already immunocompromised state of patients with HIV.')\n",

Using theories from the PM literature, we hypothesized that supporting strategic processes would improve time-based PM in the laboratory among HIV+ older adults. METHOD: One hundred forty-five HIV+ participants were randomly assigned to a control condition or an experimental group in which strategic processing was supported at encoding (i.e., implementation intentions and visualization), monitoring (i.e., content-free cuing), and/or cue detection (i.e., auditory alarm). The HIV+ control group and 58 seronegative participants completed two ongoing language tasks with a time-based PM requirement. The HIV+ experimental groups underwent counterbalanced time-based PM trials under both control and strategically supported conditions. RESULTS: The HIV+ cue-detection group showed a large within-subjects improvement, which was strongly related to lower scores on separate clinical time-based PM measure and was accompanied by a large reduction in clock-checking behavior. Results also revealed a small within-subjects improvement in time-based PM in the encoding condition. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting strategic encoding and cue-detection processes in the laboratory can improve time-based PM deficits in older HIV+ adults, which may inform the development of more naturalistic PM-based interventions to enhance health behaviors.
